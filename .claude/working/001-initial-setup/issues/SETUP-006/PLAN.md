- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Document security policies

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation
- [ ] Set up SBOM generation
- [ ] Configure vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Implement dependency checking
- [ ] Set up secrets scanning
- [ ] Configure license compliance

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality
- [ ] Test SBOM generation
- [ ] Verify vulnerability detection
- [ ] Test security workflows
- [ ] Performance impact check

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Document security processes
- [ ] Create security guidelines
- [ ] Add security commands
- [ ] Train team on security tools

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment
- [ ] Security review of setup
- [ ] Configure CI integration
- [ ] Set up automated scanning
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SBOM generation automated
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning configured
- [ ] Dependency updates monitored
- [ ] Secrets scanning enabled
- [ ] License compliance checking
