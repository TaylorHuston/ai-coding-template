# Issue Plan - SETUP-007

**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Type**: Setup/Configuration  
**Status**: Planning  
**External Ticket**: N/A  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../README.md)  

## Issue Summary

Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, security scanning, and deployment across multiple environments to ensure code quality and reliable deployments.

## User Story

As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines so that code changes are automatically tested, built, and deployed with confidence.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 - Setup & Foundation

- [ ] Evaluate CI/CD platform options
- [ ] Design pipeline architecture
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Set up CI/CD accounts/access

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation

- [ ] Create CI pipeline
  - [ ] Configure build triggers
  - [ ] Set up test stages
  - [ ] Add security scanning
  - [ ] Configure artifact generation
- [ ] Create CD pipeline
  - [ ] Set up deployment stages
  - [ ] Configure environments
  - [ ] Implement approval gates
  - [ ] Add rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Configure branch protection
  - [ ] Require CI passing
  - [ ] Set review requirements

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality

- [ ] Test all pipeline stages
- [ ] Verify deployments work
- [ ] Test rollback procedures
- [ ] Optimize pipeline performance

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish

- [ ] Document pipeline architecture
- [ ] Create deployment guides
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Add pipeline badges to README

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment

- [ ] Review pipeline security
- [ ] Test with team members
- [ ] Address feedback
- [ ] Enable for main branch

## Technical Approach

Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for pipelines with multi-stage builds, parallel testing, and progressive deployment through environments with appropriate gates.

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **Blocking**: SETUP-003 (Tests to run)
- **Blocking**: SETUP-004 (Linting configured)
- **Blocking**: SETUP-006 (Security scanning)
- **Requires**: Cloud accounts for deployment

### Risks
- Pipeline complexity: Start simple, iterate
- Cost overruns: Monitor usage, optimize

## Changelog Entry

**Type**: Added  
**Description**: CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and deployment  
**Breaking Change**: No  

## Definition of Done

- [ ] CI pipeline running on all PRs
- [ ] CD pipeline deploying successfully
- [ ] All quality gates configured
- [ ] Rollback tested
- [ ] Documentation complete
