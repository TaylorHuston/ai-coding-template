- **Reduced Support Costs**: Self-service password reset and account management
- **Enhanced Security Posture**: Protection against unauthorized access and data breaches
- **Compliance Readiness**: Meets GDPR, CCPA, and SOC 2 requirements
- **Platform Growth**: Foundation for premium features and user retention

### Success Criteria

- **User Adoption**: 90% of new users complete registration within 24 hours
- **Login Success Rate**: 98% successful login attempts
- **Support Ticket Reduction**: 40% decrease in authentication-related support requests
- **Security Incidents**: Zero security breaches related to authentication
- **Time to First Value**: Users access core features within 2 minutes of signup
