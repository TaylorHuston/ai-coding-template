# Documentation Standards

**Purpose**: Comprehensive documentation principles, structure guidelines, and maintenance practices for creating effective, maintainable, and AI-friendly documentation systems. This guide consolidates documentation philosophy, organizational patterns, and quality standards.

## Documentation Philosophy

### Core Principles

#### Minimal and Practical
- **Just enough documentation** for developers and AI to work effectively
- **Code examples over lengthy explanations** for practical learning
- **Clear boundaries** between planning documentation and implementation guides
- **Complement, not replace** project management tools and external documentation systems

#### Developer-Focused Approach
- **Docs as Code** philosophy with version control and review processes
- **Template-driven consistency** for predictable documentation structure
- **AI-assistant friendly** formatting and organization patterns
- **Immediate actionability** with working examples and step-by-step instructions

### Documentation vs External Tools

**Repository Documentation** (What we maintain):
- Technical implementation details and code patterns
- AI assistant instructions and workflow automation
- Architecture decisions and system design rationale
- Quick reference guides and troubleshooting information

**External Tool Documentation** (What we reference):
- Project management tracking (Jira, Linear, Asana)
- Business requirements and stakeholder communication (Confluence, Notion)
- Team collaboration and knowledge sharing (Slack, Teams)
- Customer-facing documentation and support materials

## Repository Documentation Structure

### Three-Tier Documentation System

#### Tier 1: Project Level
**Location**: Repository root and `docs/` directory
**Purpose**: Project-wide context, architecture, and cross-cutting concerns
**Maintenance**: Updated during major releases and architectural changes

#### Tier 2: Feature Level (Deliverables)
**Location**: `deliverables/[FEATURE]/` directories
**Purpose**: Epic-level work packages with business context and scope
**Maintenance**: Updated during feature development lifecycle

#### Tier 3: Task Level (Issues)
**Location**: `deliverables/[FEATURE]/issues/[TASK]/` directories
**Purpose**: Specific implementation tasks with detailed technical guidance
**Maintenance**: Updated during active development work

### Directory Organization Standards

#### Project Documentation (`docs/`)
- **`architecture/`**: Technical architecture and C4 model documentation
- **`api/`**: API specifications and interface documentation (when applicable)
- **`guides/`**: How-to guides and procedural documentation
- **`templates/`**: Document templates and boilerplate content

#### Architecture Documentation Structure
- **C4 Model Organization**: System context, container architecture, component details, workflow diagrams
- **Decision Records**: Architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant technical choices
- **Integration Patterns**: Service integration and communication patterns
- **Security Architecture**: Security controls and compliance frameworks

#### Deliverable Documentation Structure
- **Epic Overview**: Business goals, scope, and success metrics in deliverable README
- **Issue Planning**: Task orchestration and progress tracking in PLAN.md files
- **Implementation Guides**: Technical implementation details in issue README files

## File Standards and Conventions

### YAML Frontmatter Requirements

**Required Fields for All Documents**:
- `version`: Semantic versioning for document evolution tracking
- `created`: ISO 8601 creation date for document lifecycle management
- `last_updated`: ISO 8601 modification date for freshness indicators
- `status`: Document lifecycle status (draft, active, deprecated, archived)
- `target_audience`: Array of intended audiences for context-appropriate content

**Optional Fields for Enhanced Metadata**:
- `document_type`: Specification, guide, reference, plan for content categorization
- `priority`: Critical, high, medium, low for maintenance prioritization
- `tags`: Array of topics for discoverability and organization
- `difficulty`: Beginner, intermediate, advanced for audience targeting
- `estimated_time`: Reading time estimation for planning purposes

### File Naming Conventions

**Consistent Naming Standards**:
- **lowercase-kebab-case** exclusively for all documentation files
- **Descriptive but concise** names that clearly indicate content purpose
- **No redundant suffixes** (avoid "guide" in guides/ directory)
- **README.md standardization** for all directory documentation
- **No alternative index files** (never use INDEX.md or similar variations)

**Benefits**: GitHub auto-rendering, developer familiarity, predictable navigation, AI-friendly file discovery.

### Document Length Optimization

#### Optimal Length Targets
- **300-500 lines**: Ideal for AI context window processing efficiency
- **Sweet spot benefit**: Complete document processing in single AI context
- **Human comprehension**: Manageable length with focused topic coverage

#### Length Management Strategy
- **~1000 lines**: Consider splitting for multiple distinct topics
- **1400+ lines**: Required split for AI context management
- **2000+ lines**: Critical threshold requiring immediate attention

#### Document Splitting Best Practices
- **Logical separation**: Split along natural topic boundaries (principles vs implementation)
- **Self-contained documents**: Each split should be independently usable
- **Comprehensive cross-references**: Link related documents with clear navigation
- **Legacy preservation**: Archive original documents with split explanation

## Document Types and Templates

### PLAN.md (Task Orchestration)

**Purpose**: Task checklists, acceptance criteria, and progress tracking
**Target Length**: ~50 lines maximum
**Content Focus**: Status tracking, brief context, task organization
**Content Exclusions**: Implementation details, code examples, detailed explanations

**Template Structure**:
- Goal statement (1-2 sentences)
- Task checklist with progress indicators
- Acceptance criteria with clear verification steps
- Minimal context for AI agent understanding

### README.md (Implementation Guides)

**Purpose**: Technical implementation details, code examples, step-by-step instructions
**Target Length**: ~200 lines average
**Content Focus**: Working code, configuration examples, troubleshooting guidance
**Content Exclusions**: Status tracking, project management, high-level planning

**Template Structure**:
- Quick start section with essential commands
- Implementation section with working examples
- Testing and validation procedures
- Troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions

### Technical Guides

**Purpose**: Comprehensive technical documentation for complex topics
**Target Length**: 400-600 lines for principles, 800-1200 lines for implementation
**Content Focus**: Detailed technical concepts, patterns, and procedures
**Maintenance**: Regular review cycles and accuracy validation

## Documentation Maintenance

### Maintenance Strategies

#### Automated Maintenance
- **Link validation**: Automated checking for broken internal and external links
- **Content synchronization**: Automatic updates when referenced code changes
- **Freshness monitoring**: Alerts for documents exceeding update thresholds
- **Consistency checking**: Automated validation of formatting and structure standards

#### Manual Maintenance Cycles
- **Quarterly reviews**: Comprehensive accuracy and relevance assessment
- **Release-based updates**: Documentation updates aligned with software releases
- **Triggered maintenance**: Updates based on significant code or process changes
- **Annual optimization**: Document length analysis and splitting recommendations

### Maintenance Quality Standards

#### Content Accuracy
- **Code example validation**: All code examples must be functional and tested
- **Link verification**: Internal and external links checked for validity
