# CLAUDE.md - AI Agent Instructions

You are working with an AI coding template repository designed to optimize AI-assisted development workflows. Follow these instructions precisely when operating in this codebase.

## Essential Knowledge

### Tech Stack

<Add the high level details of your tech stack here>

### External Links

Project Management: <Add the link and details to your Jira/Linear/etc here>

Wiki: <Add the link and details to your Confluence/Notion/etc here>

## Documentation Structure

This template uses a three-tier documentation system:

- **docs/technical/** - YOUR project's technical documentation (architecture, API, database)
- **docs/development/** - Team processes and guidelines (workflows, standards, testing)
- **docs/ai-tools/** - AI assistant and template documentation (agents, commands, setup)

**Note**: This file (CLAUDE.md) contains AI instructions. For human-readable documentation about using this template, see `docs/ai-tools/`.

- [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md) - Current project context and state for session continuity

## Critical Rules

These apply to all actions and agents:

1. **Commit Approval:** Never commit without explicit user approval first
2. **Comment Approval:** Never comment on <Jira/Linear/etc> without explicit user approval first
3. **No Assumptions**: Always check existing patterns and code, run tests, ask user if any ambiguity
4. **Test First:** Follow strict TDD guidelines
5. **Branch First:** Never work directly on main branches (see [AI Collaboration Guide](./docs/ai-tools/guides/ai-collaboration-guide.md#ai-branching-strategy))
6. **Atomic Commits:** Keep commits small and focused
7. **Ask Questions Often and Early**: Clarify ambiguity before implementation

## AI Autonomy Matrix

| Action             | Permission    | Example                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Read/Analyze**   | ‚úÖ Autonomous | Reading files, analyzing code, searching  |
| **Plan/Test**      | ‚úÖ Autonomous | Creating plans, running tests, validation |
| **Code Changes**   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Show First | Display changes before applying           |
| **Commits/Merges** | üõë Always Ask | Never commit without explicit approval    |
| **Deletions**      | üõë Always Ask | Any file/branch deletions need approval   |

## Response Protocol

You MUST follow these behavioral guidelines:

- **Be Concise**: Show code/commands, explain only when asked
- **Be Explicit**: Confirm understanding before major changes
- **Be Incremental**: Work in small, atomic commits
- **Be Transparent**: Report errors immediately with context
- **Be Evidence-Based**: Support decisions with verifiable information

## File Naming Requirements

You MUST follow these naming conventions:

- **Documentation files**: Use `lowercase-kebab-case` exclusively (e.g., `authentication-guide.md`)
- **Code files**: Follow the naming conventions for the specific programming language
- **No exceptions**: Enforce these conventions in all file operations

## Context Management Protocol

## 17-Agent Framework Integration

You have access to 17 specialized agents through the `.claude/agents/` directory. Your job is to orchestrate the work of the appropriate agents for each task, including passing context between them and keeping any status files up-to-date. You should rarely be updating files yourself directly. Always delegate to the appropriate agent.

## Multi-Agent Workflow Execution

When working with deliverables that contain PLAN.md files, follow these coordination protocols:

### Phase-Based Task Execution

PLAN.md files use a structured P X.X.X format where each phase represents a logical commit boundary:

- **P1.X.X**: Core implementation phase
- **P2.X.X**: Integration/extension phase
- **P3.X.X**: Finalization phase
- Each phase follows: Analyze ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Document ‚Üí Commit

### Agent Selection from Task Hints

Tasks include agent hints in HTML comments:

- `<!--agent:context-analyzer-->` - Use context-analyzer agent
- `<!--agent:test-engineer-->` - Use test-engineer agent
- Agent selection should be specific (e.g., `<!--agent:frontend-specialist-->`) - avoid auto-selection
- `<!--agent:code-reviewer-->` - Use code-reviewer agent
- `<!--agent:docs-sync-agent-->` - Use docs-sync-agent

### HANDOFF.yml Coordination

When delegating to agents, ensure proper handoff coordination:

1. **Before Task Delegation**: Read the last 1-2 entries in HANDOFF.yml to understand current context
2. **Agent Instructions**: Include relevant context from handoffs in your Task prompts
3. **After Task Completion**: Verify the agent updated HANDOFF.yml with their findings

### RESEARCH.md Integration

Each issue includes a RESEARCH.md file for unstructured investigation findings:

1. **Context-Analyzer Tasks (P X.1.0)**: Always dump comprehensive findings to RESEARCH.md
2. **All Agents**: Reference RESEARCH.md before starting work to understand discoveries
3. **Research Contributions**: Any agent can append findings, code snippets, or observations
4. **Investigation Updates**: Update RESEARCH.md throughout the issue lifecycle as new information emerges

### CHANGELOG.md Maintenance

For user-facing changes, ensure CHANGELOG.md is kept current:

**When to Update CHANGELOG.md:**

- New features users interact with (UI components, API endpoints, commands)
- Breaking API changes or configuration changes
- Bug fixes that users would notice (not internal refactoring)
- Security vulnerability fixes
- Performance improvements users would experience
- New dependencies or system requirements

**When NOT to Update CHANGELOG.md:**

- Internal code refactoring without user impact
- Test additions or improvements
- Documentation updates (unless user-facing guides)
- Build system or CI/CD changes
- Code style or linting fixes

**Update Process:**

1. **Feature Development**: Add entries to `[Unreleased]` section for qualifying changes
2. **Bug Fixes**: Document fixes in the `Fixed` section with issue references
3. **Breaking Changes**: Mark clearly with `**BREAKING**` prefix and migration notes
4. **Final Phase Tasks**: Include CHANGELOG update as part of documentation tasks
5. **Automation Available**: Use `./scripts/ai-update-changelog.sh` for assistance

### Agent Coordination Protocol

```yaml
Required Workflow for Each Agent:
1. Read PLAN.md to understand current task (P X.X.X)
2. Read last 2 entries in HANDOFF.yml for context
3. Read RESEARCH.md for investigation findings and discoveries
4. Complete assigned work with full context
5. Update HANDOFF.yml with handoff entry
6. Update RESEARCH.md if new findings or insights emerge
7. Update CHANGELOG.md if work affects user-facing functionality
8. Update PLAN.md task status to checked
9. Provide clear summary of work completed
```

### Task Delegation Examples

**Good delegation pattern**:
"Use the Task tool with test-engineer to work on P1.2.0. Context from HANDOFF.yml shows the context-analyzer identified the need for authentication tests covering JWT token generation and validation. Create comprehensive tests for these requirements."

**Poor delegation pattern**:
"Use test-engineer to write tests." (Lacks context and specific task reference)

### Multi-Phase Coordination

- Work through phases sequentially (complete all P1.X.X before P2.X.X)
- Each phase should result in a logical, committable unit of work
- If a phase needs subdivision, use sub-task numbering (P1.3.1, P1.3.2)
- Phases can vary in length - not all require exactly 6 steps
- Customize phase structure based on complexity and requirements
- Quality gate at end of each phase: tests pass, code reviewed, documented
- STATUS.md updated with phase summary upon completion

### Agent Selection Rules

- Match agent expertise to specific task domains
- Use appropriate model complexity (haiku/sonnet/opus) for task requirements
- Plan coordination procedures for multi-agent workflows
- Monitor agent effectiveness and optimize selection patterns

## Tool Selection Guide

Use these tools appropriately for different tasks:

```yaml
Search:
  - Grep: For specific patterns and content
  - Glob: For file patterns and discovery

Code Operations:
  - Read: Always read before editing existing files
  - Edit/MultiEdit: For existing file modifications
  - Write: Only for new files

Testing:
  - Bash: Run test commands and validation
  - Read: Review test files and results

Documentation:
  - Read: Check existing documentation
  - Edit: Update existing documentation
  - Write: Create new documentation (when explicitly requested)

Project Management:
  - TodoWrite: Track progress and tasks
  - Task: Delegate to specialized agents

Deliverables:
  - Read: Review deliverables/ directory structure
  - Edit: Update PLAN.md and README.md files
  - Command System: Use commands.md for available automation
```

## Code Generation Standards

You MUST adhere to these standards:

- Follow patterns established in the `examples/` directory
- Use existing project patterns and conventions consistently
- Validate against quality standards in `docs/development/guidelines/quality-standards.md`
- Never duplicate existing functionality without explicit justification

## Quality Requirements

### Validation Protocol

1. Validate all code against project technical standards
2. Follow security best practices and established patterns
3. Document AI assistance level in all commit messages
4. Ensure comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
5. **Update CHANGELOG.md** for user-facing changes (features, fixes, breaking changes)

### Code Quality Gates

- All code MUST pass existing linting and formatting standards
- Security patterns MUST be followed for all implementations
- Performance considerations MUST be evaluated for user-facing changes

3. **Ask user** for clarification rather than making assumptions
4. **Document decision** in code comments and status files

### Issue Resolution Protocol

When encountering problems:

1. **Report immediately** with full context and error details
2. **Suggest fix** if the solution is obvious and low-risk
3. **Never hide or suppress** errors or warnings
4. **Use appropriate agent** for domain-specific problem resolution
5. **Update documentation** to prevent similar issues

### Research and Analysis

When working with unfamiliar areas:

1. Use context engineering techniques from the [AI Collaboration Guide](./docs/ai-tools/guides/ai-collaboration-guide.md#context-management)
2. Apply RAG strategies when working with large codebases
3. Reference the [AI Collaboration Guide](./docs/ai-tools/guides/ai-collaboration-guide.md#effective-ai-communication) for effective interaction patterns
4. Leverage the 17-agent framework for domain-specific expertise
5. Maintain evidence-based reasoning throughout problem-solving

## Security Compliance

You MUST:

- Apply security best practices and established patterns
- Document the level of AI assistance in all generated code
- Never compromise security for convenience or development speed

## Error Handling Protocol

When errors occur:

1. Immediately document the error context in appropriate status files
2. Apply systematic debugging using the context-analyzer agent
3. Preserve all error context for future analysis
4. Update relevant documentation to prevent similar issues
5. Ensure recovery procedures are documented and tested

## Communication Standards

You MUST:

- Use imperative, clear, and direct communication
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Include evidence and reasoning for all decisions
- Maintain professional tone in all documentation
- Structure information for easy comprehension and action

## Success Metrics

Your performance will be evaluated on:

- Adherence to context management protocols
- Appropriate use of the 17-agent framework
- Code quality and architectural consistency
- Documentation accuracy and completeness
- Security compliance maintenance
- Problem resolution effectiveness and efficiency

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Context Management Issues

1. **AI forgets previous context**: Update and reference `STATUS.md` and follow [Context Management](./docs/ai-tools/guides/ai-collaboration-guide.md#context-management)
2. **Inconsistent patterns**: Check existing code patterns before implementing
3. **Lost session context**: Follow session completion protocol properly

### File and Permission Issues

1. **Permission denied on scripts**: Run `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
2. **File not found errors**: Use absolute paths and verify file existence
3. **Git conflicts**: Always create feature branches, never work on main

### Tool and Agent Issues

1. **Agent not responding as expected**: See [Using Agents](./docs/ai-tools/guides/using-agents.md) for practical guidance
2. **Tool selection confusion**: Reference the Tool Selection Guide above and [Development Commands](./docs/ai-tools/reference/development-commands.md)
3. **MCP server failures**: Follow [MCP Setup](./docs/ai-tools/setup/mcp-setup.md) troubleshooting or fall back to native Claude tools

### Code Quality Issues

1. **Tests failing**: Run full test suite before committing changes
2. **Linting errors**: Follow existing project formatting standards
3. **Documentation out of sync**: Use docs-sync-agent after code changes

### General Troubleshooting

1. **When in doubt**: Ask the user rather than making assumptions
2. **Complex problems**: Use appropriate specialized agent and follow [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/ai-tools/reference/troubleshooting.md)
3. **Multiple issues**: Address P0/critical issues first
4. **Systematic debugging**: Follow procedures in [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/ai-tools/reference/troubleshooting.md)
