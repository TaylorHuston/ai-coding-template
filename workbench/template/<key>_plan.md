# <key> Plan

This should serve as a checklist style plan of all of the steps needed to accomplish this task. It should not contin any subjective data, assessments, etc. Just the concrete steps, so that you and the LLM are both always on the same page on exactly what it's working on.

This should be broken into Phases, with each Phase roughly coinciding with a logical point to make a commit.

Use this when prompting the LLM. For example:

"Please have the tpm and test-builder agents coordinate on implementing 5.1"

## Phase 1 - Some Action
