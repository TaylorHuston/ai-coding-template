## [0.10.0] - 2025-10-22

### NOTE

This represents a substantial rewrite to this project, with a heavy emphasis on simplifcation and streamlining to make it more of a base template than a prescriptive framework.

### Added

- **`/toolkit-init` Update/Sync Mode**: Intelligent template drift detection and selective updates
  - **Drift detection**: Compare project files vs latest plugin templates

- **Architecture Overview template**: Technical specifications document at `docs/project/architecture-overview.md`

### Changed

- **BREAKING: WORKLOG.md replaces HANDOFF.yml** - Narrative work history instead of process metadata
  - **Old system (HANDOFF.yml)**: Tracked agent handoffs, deliverables, timestamps (process overhead)
  - **New system (WORKLOG.md)**: Narrative entries with lessons learned, gotchas, context (~500 char entries)
  - **Format**: `## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - agent-name` or `@username` for humans
  - **Entry order**: Reverse chronological (newest first for easy scanning)
  - **Accurate timestamps**: Uses `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M'` command (no date estimation)
  - **Content**: Summary + Gotchas/Lessons + Files changed (helps AI remember context)
  - **Bidirectional**: Both AI agents (via `/implement`) and humans (via `/comment`) add entries
  - **Purpose**: Solves "AI forgets context" problem with implementation insights, not just metadata
  - **Migration**: HANDOFF.yml was never fully adopted, clean break for alpha/beta plugin

- **`/toolkit-init` enhanced**: Now supports update/sync mode instead of exiting on re-init
  - **Old behavior**: Exit with "already initialized" message
  - **New behavior**: Compare templates, offer selective updates
  - **Flags added**: `--force` (overwrite all), `--dry-run` (preview only)

- **BREAKING: Command consolidation** - 21 → 14 commands (added `/comment`)
  - Consolidated: `/docs-*` (5 commands) → `/docs` (natural language)
  - Removed: `/review` (→ `/quality`), `/refresh` (→ `/status`), `/design` (redundant), `/improve` (obsolete)

- **Template Distribution**: Moved `starter-template/` to `plugins/ai-toolkit/templates/starter/`
  - Templates now bundled with plugin for offline initialization
  - Users no longer need to manually copy starter-template files
  - Template version stays locked to plugin version for consistency
  - 94% size reduction (1MB → 60K)

## [0.9.0] - 2025-10-19

### Changed

  - **Starter Template**: Pre-configured project structure separate from plugin
    - Template includes: CLAUDE.md, README.md, docs structure, .gitignore
    - Removed `.claude/cache/` directory (plugins installed globally, not cached per-project)
    - Users copy `starter-template/` to their project after installing plugin
    - Documentation moved to `starter-template/docs/` (project, development, ai-toolkit tiers)
  - **Script Updates**: All core scripts updated for plugin environment
    - Updated `scripts/lib/logging.sh` to use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` with fallback

  - Removed license type prompt (LICENSE file is deleted anyway, users add their own)
  - STATUS.md now created fresh instead of sed replacements (removes all template development history)
  - Added .serena/ directory cleanup (template's code analysis cache shouldn't transfer to user projects)
  - Added CONTRIBUTING.md cleanup (template-specific contributing guidelines don't apply to user projects)
  - Result: Faster initialization, cleaner project files, no confusing template artifacts

- **Architect Command Enhancement**: Added explicit `--question` flag for direct questions
  - New flag: `--question "text"` for explicit Direct Question mode
  - Backward compatible: Quoted strings still work without flag
  - Eliminates quote-detection ambiguity for clearer user intent
  - Updated argument-hint to show all available flags and modes
  - Result: More predictable command parsing, better UX for quick architectural questions

  - New flag: `--failed-only` - Re-run only previously failed tests
  - New flag: `--watch` - Watch mode for continuous testing on file changes
  - Flags combinable: `--type unit --failed-only` for fastest iteration
  - Result: Faster test iterations, developer productivity improvements

### Removed

- **Workbench STATUS.md**: Deleted outdated status file from NPM distribution phase
  - File was stale and duplicated root STATUS.md
  - Workbench directory is for active development only
  - Root STATUS.md remains as authoritative project status

## [0.8.1] - 2025-10-04

### Changed

- **Quick Start Documentation**: Added init-project script to all Quick Start options in README.md
  - All installation methods (GitHub Template, degit, manual clone) now clearly show the critical initialization step
  - Updated First Steps section to reflect what init-project creates automatically
  - Prevents users from skipping transformation step that customizes template for their project
  - Result: Users understand that init-project is required for ALL installation methods, not just degit

## [0.8.0] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed

- **Critical Setup Script Bug**: Fixed PROJECT_ROOT path calculation in setup-manager.sh
  - **Problem**: PROJECT_ROOT was resolving to `.claude/` instead of project root directory
  - **Root Cause**: Script moved from `scripts/setup/` to `.claude/resources/scripts/setup/` but path calculation not updated
  - **Impact**: LICENSE deletion, README customization, and git operations were using wrong base directory
  - **Solution**: Changed `PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$SCRIPTS_ROOT/../.." && pwd)"` to `PROJECT_ROOT="$(cd "$SCRIPTS_ROOT/../../.." && pwd)"`
  - **Result**: All init-project operations now correctly operate on project root

- **Documentation Path Accuracy**: Fixed incorrect script paths across multiple documentation files
  - **quick-start.md**: Updated 8+ script paths from `.resources/` to `.claude/resources/`
  - **integration-guide.md**: Fixed placeholder URLs and incorrect file references
  - **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Updated references to match new directory structure
  - **STATUS.md**: Refreshed next steps to reflect current project state
  - **Result**: All documentation paths now accurate after directory reorganization

- **README Documentation Accuracy**: Fixed multiple incorrect commands and references in project documentation
  - **Root README.md**: Fixed non-existent `npx ai-assisted-template setup` command references and updated GitHub URLs from placeholder "yourusername" to "TaylorHuston"
  - **Usage Guide**: Fixed incorrect script paths and GitHub URL placeholders in `docs/ai-toolkit/README.md`:
    - Updated GitHub URLs from "yourusername" to "TaylorHuston"
    - Replaced non-existent `npm run demo` with `npx ai-assisted-template status`
    - Fixed script paths: `setup-manager.sh` → `setup/setup-manager.sh`, `ai-status.sh` → `status/ai-status.sh`
  - **Result**: All documentation now contains only valid commands and accurate file paths

### Changed

- **Directory Structure Reorganization**: Moved `.resources/` to `.claude/resources/` for consistent .claude/ namespace
  - **Migration**: 254 files moved from `.resources/` to `.claude/resources/`
  - **Path Updates**: Updated all script paths, documentation references, and command configurations
  - **Structure**: All AI toolkit files now under single `.claude/` directory (agents, commands, resources, references)
  - **Benefits**: Cleaner namespace, consistent organization, easier .claude/ directory management
  - **Impact**: Updated 50+ file references across codebase to use new paths

- **README Consolidation**: Streamlined root documentation from two files to one
  - **Removed**: README-DEV.md (alpha-phase version with outdated content)
  - **Enhanced**: README.md with improved problem/solution framing
  - **Added**: "Why Intelligent Agent Coordination Matters" section to docs/ai-toolkit/README.md
  - **Result**: Single authoritative README with clear value proposition and accurate workflows

- **Documentation Structure Reorganization**: Improved documentation organization for better clarity and discoverability
  - **Directory Renaming**:
    - `docs/ai-tools/` → `docs/ai-toolkit/` - Better reflects the comprehensive AI development toolkit nature
    - `docs/technical/` → `docs/project/` - More intuitive naming for project-specific documentation
  - **Path Updates**: Updated all 50+ file references across codebase to use new directory structure
  - **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Maintained all internal links and cross-references during restructuring
  - **Package Distribution**: Updated NPM package configuration to include new documentation paths

- **Command Header Standardization**: Implemented consistent header format across all custom commands for improved maintainability
  - **Standardized YAML Frontmatter**: Unified structure with version, dates, status, audience, and model specifications
  - **Agent Coordination Sections**: Clear specification of primary, supporting, and quality gate agents for each command
  - **Consistent Titles**: Unified `/command-name Command` format across all 14 commands
  - **Usage Documentation**: Standardized argument hints, examples, and usage patterns

### Removed

- **LICENSE File from Template**: Removed template LICENSE during project initialization
  - **Rationale**: Template LICENSE was confusing - users thought it enforced license requirements on their projects
  - **Implementation**: init-project script now deletes LICENSE before git commit
  - **Manifest Update**: LICENSE added to "ignore" category (never syncs)
  - **Guidance**: Users should add their own LICENSE appropriate for their project
  - **Result**: Clean slate for users to choose their own license without confusion

### Added

- **CLAUDE.md Two-File System**: Preserves project customizations while allowing template improvements
  - **Template Reference**: `.claude/CLAUDE-template.md` syncs with template improvements
  - **Project Version**: Root `CLAUDE.md` never syncs, preserves customizations
  - **Helper Commands**: `claude-diff` and `claude-status` for comparing versions
  - **Tracking Header**: Clear guidance in root CLAUDE.md on template relationship
  - **Manifest Update**: Root CLAUDE.md moved to "user" category (preserve strategy)
  - **Result**: Users can customize CLAUDE.md while still receiving template improvements via manual merge

- **Template Development Sync System**: Bidirectional sync for active template development while building real projects
  - **Manifest-Driven**: Uses `.template-manifest.json` to identify template vs project files
  - **Sync Commands**: `pull`, `push`, `status`, `diff` for complete workflow
  - **Smart Detection**: Auto-detects template directory from common locations
  - **Conflict Handling**: Timestamp-based conflict detection with force override option
  - **Configuration**: `.template-dev.json` for user-specific settings (git-ignored)
