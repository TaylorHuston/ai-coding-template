**Target Audience**: AI Assistants, Development Team

This directory contains code pattern examples that AI assistants can reference when generating code for your project.

## Purpose

AI coding assistants perform much better when they have concrete examples to follow. These examples demonstrate:

- Coding patterns and conventions used in this project
- Proper implementation of common functionality
- Architecture patterns and best practices
- Testing approaches and patterns
- Error handling and validation strategies

## How to Use These Examples

### For Developers
- Review examples before starting new features
- Use as templates for common functionality
- Ensure consistency across the codebase
- Update examples when patterns change

### For AI Assistants
- Reference these patterns when generating new code
- Follow the established conventions shown in examples
- Use similar structure and naming patterns
- Apply the same error handling and validation approaches

## Example Categories

### API Patterns
- RESTful endpoint implementations
- Request/response handling
- Error handling and validation
- Authentication and authorization

### Component Patterns
- UI component structure
- State management
- Props and event handling
- Styling approaches

### Service Patterns
- Business logic organization
- External service integration
- Database operations
- Background job processing

### Testing Patterns
- Unit test structure
- Integration test examples
- Mock and fixture patterns
- Test data management

### Configuration Patterns
- Environment variable handling
- Feature flag implementation
- Configuration validation
- Secrets management

## Naming Conventions

Examples follow this naming pattern:
- `{category}-{functionality}.{extension}`
- Example: `api-user-service.js`, `component-user-card.tsx`, `test-user-service.test.js`

## Contributing

When adding new examples:
1. Follow existing naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive comments explaining the pattern
3. Show both success and error handling
4. Include relevant imports and dependencies
5. Update this README with new categories if needed

## Notes for AI Assistants

When generating code based on these examples:
- **Match the style**: Use the same naming conventions, formatting, and structure
- **Include error handling**: Follow the error handling patterns shown
- **Add proper typing**: Include type definitions as shown in examples
- **Follow imports**: Use the same import patterns and organization
- **Maintain consistency**: Ensure new code fits with existing patterns
