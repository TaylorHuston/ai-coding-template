## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.2] - 2025-09-19

### Fixed

- **MCP Configuration**: Fixed NPM package to use correct template `.mcp.json` file for new projects
  - **Problem**: Package was including template's active `.mcp.json` (with Serena enabled) instead of the template for new projects
  - **Solution**: Removed `.mcp.json` from NPM package files and added special CLI handling to use `.resources/templates/config/mcp.template.json`
  - **Result**: New projects now correctly get `.mcp.json` with Serena commented out, preventing indexing delays on fresh installations

## [0.6.1] - 2025-09-19

### Enhanced

- **Smart Serena Activation**: Implemented optional Serena MCP activation for new projects
  - **Problem**: Fresh template installations experienced indexing delays from Serena on minimal codebases
  - **Solution**: New projects get Serena commented out in `.mcp.json` template by default
  - **User Control**: Users activate Serena when project reaches 20+ implementation files
  - **Benefits**: Immediate productivity for new projects, semantic analysis when beneficial
  - **Documentation**: Added comprehensive Serena activation guide and updated tool selection framework
