# [Feature Name] Architecture

## Overview

Brief description of what this feature does and why it's needed.

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Diagram
```
[Add diagram here - use Mermaid, ASCII art, or link to image]
```

### Key Components
- **Component 1**: Description and responsibility
- **Component 2**: Description and responsibility
- **Component 3**: Description and responsibility

### Data Flow
1. Step 1: What happens first
2. Step 2: How data moves through the system
3. Step 3: Final output or storage

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Key tables and relationships
CREATE TABLE example_table (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    -- Add relevant columns
);
```

### API Endpoints
```
GET /api/v1/resource          # Description
POST /api/v1/resource         # Description
PUT /api/v1/resource/:id      # Description
DELETE /api/v1/resource/:id   # Description
```

### Configuration
```yaml
# Required configuration
feature_name:
  enabled: true
  option1: value
  option2: value
```

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **Service A**: What it provides to this feature
- **Database**: Tables/schemas required
- **Authentication**: Authorization requirements

### External Dependencies
- **Third-party API**: Purpose and integration method
- **Library/Package**: Version requirements and usage

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: How users are verified
- **Authorization**: Permission requirements
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data handling
- **Input Validation**: How inputs are sanitized

## Performance Requirements

- **Response Time**: Target response times
- **Throughput**: Expected load capacity
- **Scalability**: How to scale this feature
- **Monitoring**: Key metrics to track

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test critical business logic
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify error handling

### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints
- Verify database interactions
- Test with realistic data

### End-to-End Tests

- Verify cross-system integration
- Performance testing scenarios

## Error Handling

### Expected Errors
- **Error Type 1**: Cause and handling strategy
- **Error Type 2**: Cause and handling strategy

### Fallback Behavior
- What happens when the feature is unavailable
- Graceful degradation approach
- User experience during failures

## Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics
- **Performance**: Response times, throughput
- **Errors**: Error rates and types
- **Usage**: Feature adoption and usage patterns

### Logging
- Important events to log
- Log levels and content
- PII and security considerations

### Alerts
- Conditions that should trigger alerts
- Alert thresholds and escalation

## Deployment & Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
FEATURE_API_KEY=your_api_key
FEATURE_DATABASE_URL=your_db_url
FEATURE_CACHE_TTL=3600
```

### Infrastructure Requirements
- Required services or containers
- Network access requirements
- Storage requirements

### Migration Path
- Steps to deploy this feature
- Database migration scripts
- Rollback procedures

## Future Considerations

### Known Limitations
