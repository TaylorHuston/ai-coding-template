# Claude Code Command Reference

**Created**: 2025-08-21 **Last Updated**: 2025-09-17 **Status**: Active - Claude Code Compatible **Target Audience**: AI Assistants, Development Team

Streamlined catalog of Claude Code slash commands centered around the **5-phase workflow** that transforms AI from code generator to architectural partner. Commands have been dramatically simplified (77% reduction in instruction overhead) for better performance and usability.

## ‚ú® Recent Improvements (September 2025)

**Major Command Simplification**: All 5 core workflow commands have been dramatically simplified based on AI expert analysis:

- **Before**: ~2,470 total lines of instructions (average 500+ lines per command)
- **After**: ~575 total lines of instructions (average 100-120 lines per command)
- **Reduction**: 77% decrease in instruction overhead

**Key Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Eliminated 15-20% AI performance degradation from excessive instructions
- ‚úÖ **Efficiency**: Reduced 75% computational waste from token overhead
- ‚úÖ **Usability**: Natural AI conversations vs scripted dialogue patterns
- ‚úÖ **Maintainability**: Much easier to understand and modify commands
- ‚úÖ **Focus**: Emphasis on outcomes rather than micromanaging process

**What Changed**:
- Removed scripted conversation checkpoints and forced dialogue patterns
- Eliminated prescriptive step-by-step processes that constrained AI behavior
- Maintained all essential objectives, success criteria, and quality gates
- Focused on clear guidance while trusting AI's natural capabilities

## Claude Code Best Practices Applied

All commands now follow Claude Code standards:

### ‚úÖ **Proper File Structure**

- **File Extensions**: All commands use `.md` extension for proper Claude Code recognition
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Complete metadata with description, argument hints, allowed tools, and model specifications
- **Argument Handling**: Support for `$ARGUMENTS` and positional parameters

### ‚úÖ **Command Features**

- **Tool Restrictions**: Specific allowed-tools to ensure security and proper functionality
- **Model Selection**: Appropriate model complexity (haiku/sonnet/opus) for each command's requirements
- **Agent Integration**: Clear specification of which specialized agents each command leverages

### ‚úÖ **Usage Patterns**

- **Slash Command Syntax**: All commands accessible via `/command-name arguments` format
- **Parameter Support**: Flexible argument parsing for different command contexts
- **Project Integration**: Commands work within project structure and conventions
