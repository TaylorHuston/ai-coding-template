# ADR-001: Database Technology Selection

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-09-15
**Deciders**: Tech Lead, Senior Developer, Database Administrator
**Consulted**: Development Team, DevOps Engineer
**Informed**: Product Manager, Engineering Manager

## Context

Our application needs to store user data, application state, and business entities. We need to choose a primary database technology for the initial version of our system.

Current requirements:
- Support for complex relational data
- ACID compliance for financial transactions
- Ability to handle 10,000+ concurrent users initially
- Strong consistency requirements
- Need for complex queries and reporting
- Team has experience with SQL databases

Future considerations:
- May need to scale to 100,000+ users
- Potential need for geographic distribution
- Integration with analytics and reporting tools

## Decision

We will use **PostgreSQL** as our primary database technology.

Specific implementation details:
- PostgreSQL version 15 or later
- Use connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Implement read replicas for scaling reads
- Use database migrations for schema management
- Leverage PostgreSQL-specific features (JSONB, arrays, etc.)

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: MySQL
- **Description**: Popular open-source relational database
- **Pros**:
  - Team familiarity
  - Large community and tooling ecosystem
  - Good performance for read-heavy workloads
- **Cons**:
  - Less advanced features compared to PostgreSQL
  - Weaker consistency guarantees in some configurations
  - Limited support for complex data types
- **Reason for rejection**: PostgreSQL offers better feature set for our complex data requirements

### Option 2: MongoDB
- **Description**: Document-based NoSQL database
- **Pros**:
  - Flexible schema
  - Good horizontal scaling
  - Natural fit for JSON-like data
- **Cons**:
  - Team lacks NoSQL experience
  - No ACID guarantees across documents (initially)
  - Complex queries can be difficult
  - Potential for data inconsistency
- **Reason for rejection**: ACID requirements and team experience favor relational database

### Option 3: Amazon RDS Aurora
- **Description**: Cloud-native MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible database
- **Pros**:
  - Managed service reduces operational overhead
  - Automatic scaling and high availability
  - Good performance
- **Cons**:
  - Vendor lock-in to AWS
  - Higher cost than self-managed
  - Less control over configuration
- **Reason for rejection**: Team prefers to start with self-managed solution for cost and control

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Strong ACID compliance**: Ensures data consistency for financial operations
- **Rich feature set**: JSONB, arrays, and advanced indexing support complex use cases
- **Mature ecosystem**: Extensive tooling, libraries, and community support
- **Performance**: Excellent query optimizer and performance characteristics
- **Extensibility**: Plugin architecture allows for future enhancements

### Negative Consequences
- **Operational complexity**: Requires database administration expertise
- **Vertical scaling limits**: Eventually will need sharding or read replicas for scale
- **Resource usage**: Can be memory and CPU intensive under load
- **Learning curve**: Some team members need to learn PostgreSQL-specific features

### Neutral Consequences
- **Hosting flexibility**: Can run on-premises or any cloud provider
- **Backup requirements**: Need to implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- **Monitoring needs**: Requires database-specific monitoring and alerting

## Implementation Notes

**Timeline**: Complete migration to PostgreSQL within 2 sprints

**Dependencies**:
- Set up PostgreSQL development and staging environments
- Train team on PostgreSQL-specific features and best practices
- Establish backup and monitoring procedures

**Migration Path**:
1. Set up PostgreSQL instances in all environments
2. Create initial schema using database migrations
3. Migrate development and testing workflows
4. Performance test with realistic data volumes

**Success Metrics**:
- All functional requirements met
- Response times under 200ms for 95% of queries
- Zero data loss during migration
- Team comfortable with new database within 1 month

## Follow-up Actions

- [x] Set up PostgreSQL development environment
- [x] Create initial database schema
- [ ] Implement connection pooling
- [ ] Set up database monitoring
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Train team on PostgreSQL best practices
- [ ] Performance test with production-like data
