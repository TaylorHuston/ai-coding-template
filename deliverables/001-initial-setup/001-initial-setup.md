# Initial Project Setup - Foundation Deliverable

> **ðŸ“Œ EXAMPLE DELIVERABLE**  
> This is a fully-functional example that demonstrates the deliverable template structure.
> You can:
> - **Use it as-is** for your project setup (recommended for new projects)
> - **Delete it entirely** if you don't need it (`rm -rf deliverables/001-initial-setup`)
> - **Customize it** by modifying or removing specific setup issues
>
> All setup tasks are based on 2025 industry best practices and are genuinely useful.

## Executive Summary

Establish all foundational elements required for a professional software project including repository setup, development environment, testing framework, CI/CD pipelines, and team processes. This deliverable ensures the project starts with industry best practices and sustainable development workflows.

## What We're Building

A complete project foundation that enables developers to start feature development with confidence, knowing that all essential infrastructure, tooling, and processes are in place. After completion, the team will have automated testing, consistent code quality, comprehensive observability, and reliable deployment pipelines.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
- Starting projects without proper setup leads to technical debt from day one
- Inconsistent development practices cause integration issues and delays
- Missing infrastructure results in production issues that could have been prevented
- Poor onboarding experience slows down team scaling

### Success Criteria
- Development environment setup takes <30 minutes for new team members
- All code changes pass through automated quality gates
- Security vulnerabilities detected before reaching production
- Team follows consistent, documented processes
- Zero critical setup items missing when feature development begins

## Scope

### In Scope
**Phase 1 (Foundation)**:
- Repository initialization with proper structure (SETUP-001)
- Development environment standardization (SETUP-002)
- Testing framework implementation (SETUP-003)
- Code quality automation (SETUP-004)

**Phase 2 (Operations)**:
- Observability and monitoring setup (SETUP-005)
- Security scanning and SBOM generation (SETUP-006)
- CI/CD pipeline configuration (SETUP-007)

**Phase 3 (Process)**:
- Documentation foundation (SETUP-008)
- Development processes and workflows (SETUP-009)

### Out of Scope
- Feature development
- Production infrastructure provisioning
- Third-party service integrations
- Custom tooling development
- Performance optimization

## Technical Overview

### Architecture Approach
Implement industry-standard tools and patterns that work across different technology stacks, with emphasis on automation, observability, and security from the start.

### Technology Stack
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub/GitLab
- **Containers**: Docker for development environment
- **Testing**: Jest/pytest with 80% coverage minimum
- **Observability**: OpenTelemetry with Jaeger/Prometheus/Grafana
- **Security**: SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, secrets detection
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
- **Documentation**: Markdown with static site generation

### Key Technical Decisions
- **OpenTelemetry for observability**: Vendor-neutral, future-proof
- **SBOM from day one**: Supply chain security is critical in 2025
- **Docker for development**: Ensures consistency across team
- **Conventional Commits**: Enables automation and clarity

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Team agreement on technology choices
- Repository hosting platform account
- Development machines with sufficient resources
- Basic tooling installed (Git, Docker, IDE)

### This Deliverable Blocks
- All feature development
- Production deployment
- Team scaling
- Security compliance

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Over-engineering initial setup | Medium | Medium | Start with essentials, iterate based on needs |
| Team resistance to new processes | Low | High | Involve team in decisions, provide training |
| Tool compatibility issues | Low | Medium | Test on all team platforms early |
| Setup taking longer than estimated | Medium | Low | Parallelize work across team members |

## Notes for AI Implementation

When working on these setup issues:
1. Adapt all examples to the project's chosen technology stack
2. Prioritize simplicity and maintainability over complexity
3. Ensure all configurations are well-documented
4. Test everything on a fresh environment before considering complete
5. Follow the principle of "secure by default"
6. Consider cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Mac/Linux)
7. Use automation wherever possible to reduce manual work

Each issue has detailed implementation guides, but feel free to adapt based on project-specific requirements while maintaining the core objectives.

**Remember**: This deliverable is the foundation for all future work. Take time to get it right, as changes later will be more expensive. The goal is to have zero "I wish we had set this up earlier" moments.
