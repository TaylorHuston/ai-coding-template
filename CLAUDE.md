# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Instructions

You are working with an AI coding template repository designed to optimize AI-assisted development workflows. Follow these instructions precisely when operating in this codebase.

## Core Principles

- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)
- YAGNI (You Aren't Going To Need It)
- SOLID
- Single Source Of Truth
- NEVER CLAIM TO HAVE FIXED AN ISSUE OR HAVE COMPLETED A TASK UNTIL YOU HAVE A > 95% LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT YOU'VE DONE SO

## Critical Rules

1. **Commit Approval**: Never commit without explicit user approval first, never release without explicit user approval first, never NPM publish without explicit approval first
2. **Deletion Approval**: Always ask before any file/branch deletions
3. **Test First**: Follow strict BDD/TDD guidelines
4. **Branch First**: Never work directly on main branches
5. **File Naming**: Use lowercase-kebab-case for documentation files
6. **No Assumptions**: Always check existing patterns and code, run tests, ask user if any ambiguity
7. **Ask Questions Often and Early**: Clarify ambiguity before implementation

## Project Context

- **Project Structure**: Dual-purpose repository containing both AI workflow template (root) and example application code (`src/`)
- **Tech Stack**: [Add the high level details of your tech stack here]
- **External Links**: Project Management: [Add link to Jira/Linear/etc], Wiki: [Add link to Confluence/Notion/etc]
- **Project Brief**: `docs/project-brief.md` - Contains problem statement, solution approach, and core features
- **Documentation Structure**: Three-tier system (docs/technical/, docs/development/, docs/ai-tools/)
- **Application Code**: All implementation code resides in `src/` following standard project structure
- **Active Development Context**: `.claude/working/[issue-id]/` contains ephemeral work artifacts

## Core Workflow

**Primary**: `/design` ‚Üí `/architect` ‚Üí `/plan` ‚Üí `/develop`

**Available Commands**: 13 total - Core workflow (design, architect, plan, develop), Quality (quality, review, security-audit, test-fix), Development (commit, merge-branch), Management (status, docs, refresh)

**Automation Scripts**: 20+ specialized scripts for documentation, validation, setup, metrics, changelog management

**Complete Reference**: [docs/ai-tools/reference/commands.md](./docs/ai-tools/reference/commands.md)

## AI Autonomy Matrix

| Action             | Permission    | Example                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Read/Analyze**   | ‚úÖ Autonomous | Reading files, analyzing code, searching  |
| **Plan/Test**      | ‚úÖ Autonomous | Creating plans, running tests, validation |
| **Code Changes**   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Show First | Display changes before applying           |
| **Commits/Merges** | üõë Always Ask | Never commit without explicit approval    |
| **Deletions**      | üõë Always Ask | Any file/branch deletions need approval   |

## Response Protocol

- **Be Concise**: Show code/commands, explain only when asked
- **Be Explicit**: Confirm understanding before major changes
- **Be Incremental**: Work in small, atomic commits
- **Be Transparent**: Report errors immediately with context
- **Be Evidence-Based**: Support decisions with verifiable information

## AI Agent System

- **18 specialized agents** available for domain expertise
- **Auto-activation** based on task context
- **Agent coordination** through HANDOFF.yml and RESEARCH.md files

**Core Agents**: brief-strategist, code-architect, frontend-specialist, backend-specialist, database-specialist, test-engineer, code-reviewer, security-auditor, performance-optimizer, devops-engineer, technical-writer, context-analyzer, project-manager, api-designer, refactoring-specialist, migration-specialist, data-analyst, ai-llm-expert

**Agent Guidelines**: Each agent loads domain-specific guidelines from `docs/development/guidelines/` when starting work. See `.claude/agents/guideline-mapping.yml` for complete agent-to-guideline mappings.

**Complete Guide**: [docs/ai-tools/guides/comprehensive-agent-guide.md](./docs/ai-tools/guides/comprehensive-agent-guide.md)

## Universal Quality Standards

- Follow patterns established in the `.resources/examples/` directory
- Use existing project patterns and conventions consistently
- Never duplicate existing functionality without explicit justification
- **Update CHANGELOG.md** for user-facing changes (features, fixes, breaking changes)

**Domain-Specific Guidelines**: Specialized agents load relevant guidelines from `docs/development/guidelines/` as needed for their work domain (API design, security, testing, documentation, etc.)

- **Current Status**: [STATUS.md](./STATUS.md) - Current project context and state

## Problem-Solving Framework

1. **For Architectural Decisions**: Use `/design` ‚Üí `/architect` workflow with specialist consultation
2. **For Implementation Planning**: Use `/plan` to get comprehensive multi-agent analysis
3. **For Execution Issues**: Use appropriate agent for domain expertise
4. **Check existing patterns** in similar files and components
5. **Run tests** to validate current assumptions and functionality
6. **Ask user** for clarification rather than making assumptions
7. **Document decisions** in appropriate workflow artifacts

## Context-Efficient Workflow

**Just-In-Time Guideline Loading**: Agents load domain-specific guidelines only when needed to prevent context waste:

1. **Agent Selection**: Choose appropriate agent for the task domain
2. **Guideline Loading**: Agent automatically loads relevant guidelines from `docs/development/guidelines/`
3. **Domain Focus**: Agent applies specific expertise without irrelevant context
4. **Universal Rules**: Core rules from CLAUDE.md always apply regardless of domain

**Example**: API work ‚Üí api-designer agent loads api-guidelines.md and architectural-principles.md (not testing or security guidelines unless needed)

## MCP Tool Decision Framework

**Select appropriate tools based on project complexity and available MCP servers:**

### **Tool Selection by Project Maturity**

**Fresh/Small Projects** (minimal implementation code):
- **File Discovery**: Use Glob for template/file finding
- **Code Analysis**: Use Grep for basic text search
- **Template Search**: Always use Glob
- **Reasoning**: Serena provides limited value for minimal projects (per Serena documentation)

**Growing Projects** (developing codebase):
- **File Discovery**: Primarily Glob, consider activating Serena for complex analysis
- **Code Analysis**: Grep for simple tasks, Serena for semantic understanding when beneficial
- **Template Search**: Always use Glob

**Complex Projects** (substantial codebase with 20+ files):
- **File Discovery**: Serena for semantic analysis and pattern detection
- **Code Analysis**: Serena for cross-references, structure analysis, and complex operations
- **Template Search**: Always use Glob

### **Serena Activation Strategy**

**Default for New Projects**: Serena is commented out in `.mcp.json` to avoid indexing overhead

**When to Activate Serena**:
- Project has 20+ implementation files
- Complex code structure needing semantic analysis
- Refactoring tasks requiring cross-reference analysis

**How to Activate**: See [Serena Activation Guide](./docs/ai-tools/setup/serena-activation.md)

### **MCP Tool Triggers**

- "across multiple files" ‚Üí Use Glob/Grep for small projects, Serena for complex projects
- "find all instances" ‚Üí Use appropriate search tool based on project complexity
- "consolidate" or "merge" ‚Üí Serena if available and beneficial, Grep for simple cases
- "analyze structure" ‚Üí Serena for complex projects, Glob/Grep for simple projects
- "understand patterns" ‚Üí Context7 + appropriate analysis tool
- "complex problem" ‚Üí Sequential thinking decomposition
- **"create new files" ‚Üí Always search for templates using Glob first**

**Default Principle**: Start simple (Glob/Grep), upgrade to semantic analysis (Serena) when project complexity justifies it

## Security & Quality Compliance

- Document AI assistance level in all generated code
- Never compromise security for convenience or development speed
- All code MUST pass existing linting and formatting standards
- Tests MUST be written or updated for all functional changes

**Domain-Specific Security**: Security-auditor and relevant agents load security-guidelines.md and authentication-authorization.md when working on security-critical code

## Override Instructions Priority

When in doubt, prioritize:

1. Context preservation and management
2. Architectural consistency and patterns
3. Security compliance requirements
4. Code quality and testing standards
5. Documentation accuracy and completeness

Follow these instructions precisely to ensure optimal AI-assisted development workflow in this repository.
