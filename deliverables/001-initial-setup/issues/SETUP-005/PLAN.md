# SETUP-005: Observability & Monitoring

## Goal

Implement comprehensive observability using OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, metrics, and structured logging to enable proactive monitoring and faster debugging.

## Tasks

### Phase 1 - Setup & Foundation
- [ ] Research observability requirements
- [ ] Choose observability stack components
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Plan metrics and traces

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation
- [ ] Install OpenTelemetry SDK
- [ ] Configure distributed tracing
- [ ] Set up metrics collection
- [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Configure monitoring dashboards

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality
- [ ] Test trace propagation
- [ ] Verify metrics accuracy
- [ ] Test alerting rules
- [ ] Performance impact assessment

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Document monitoring setup
- [ ] Create runbook procedures
- [ ] Add monitoring commands
- [ ] Train team on dashboards

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment
- [ ] Review monitoring strategy
- [ ] Set up production monitoring
- [ ] Configure alerting
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OpenTelemetry SDK configured
- [ ] Distributed tracing functional
- [ ] Metrics collection working
- [ ] Structured logging implemented
- [ ] Dashboards created and accessible
- [ ] Alerting rules configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring enabled
- [ ] Error tracking functional
- [ ] SLO/SLI monitoring setup
