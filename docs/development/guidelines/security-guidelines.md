# Security Guidelines

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security principles, implementation patterns, and governance frameworks for building secure, compliant, and resilient systems. This guide consolidates security philosophy, threat modeling, implementation practices, and compliance requirements.

## Security Philosophy

### Security by Design
- Security considerations integrated from project inception
- Threat modeling conducted for all major features
- Defense in depth strategy with multiple security layers
- Zero trust architecture principles applied

### Proactive Security
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Continuous monitoring and threat detection
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Incident response procedures documented and tested

### AI-Assisted Security
- AI-generated code receives enhanced security review
- Automated security pattern detection and validation
- Human oversight for all security-critical implementations
- Security training data and patterns maintained

## Core Security Principles

### Principle of Least Privilege

**Core Concept**: Users, applications, and systems should have only the minimum access necessary to perform their functions.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Grant minimal required permissions for specific operations
- Use temporary permissions with automatic expiration
- Implement regular permission auditing and cleanup
- Justify all permission grants with business requirements
- Automate permission lifecycle management

**Key Benefits**: Reduces attack surface, limits blast radius of compromised accounts, ensures compliance with access control requirements.

### Defense in Depth

**Core Concept**: Multiple layers of security controls to protect against various attack vectors. No single security measure should be relied upon.

**Security Layers**:
- **Network Layer**: Firewalls, intrusion detection, DDoS protection
- **Application Layer**: Input validation, output encoding, CSRF protection, rate limiting
- **Authentication Layer**: Multi-factor authentication, password policies, session management
- **Authorization Layer**: Role-based access, attribute-based access, resource permissions
- **Data Layer**: Encryption at rest and in transit, data classification, backup security
- **Monitoring Layer**: Security logging, anomaly detection, threat intelligence, incident response

**Strategy**: Each layer should be independent and provide protection even if other layers fail. Design for redundancy and overlapping controls.

### Zero Trust Architecture

**Core Concept**: Never trust, always verify - assume no implicit trust based on network location or previous authentication.

**Verification Framework**:
- **Identity Verification**: Multi-factor authentication, continuous identity validation
- **Device Verification**: Device fingerprinting, device trust scoring, known device tracking
- **Location Verification**: Geographic analysis, VPN detection, unusual location flagging
- **Behavior Verification**: User behavior analysis, anomaly detection, pattern recognition
- **Resource Verification**: Resource sensitivity assessment, access pattern analysis
- **Context Verification**: Time-based access, request context analysis

**Trust Scoring**: Combine verification results into weighted trust scores that determine access levels and additional security controls.

### Fail Secure

**Core Concept**: When systems fail, they should fail to a secure state rather than an open state. Default to denying access when in doubt.

**Implementation Principles**:
- **Default Deny**: Access should be explicitly granted, never assumed
- **Error Handling**: Any system errors should result in access denial
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain security even when dependent services fail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all failures for security monitoring and analysis
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Design secure fallbacks for critical system failures

**Security Benefits**: Prevents unauthorized access during system failures, maintains security posture during outages, provides clear audit trails for investigation.

## Threat Modeling

### STRIDE Methodology

Systematic approach to identifying security threats:
- **Spoofing**: Identity verification attacks
- **Tampering**: Unauthorized data modification
- **Repudiation**: Denying actions performed
- **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized data access
- **Denial of Service**: System availability attacks
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Unauthorized access escalation

### Attack Surface Analysis

**Surface Components**:
- **Network Surface**: Open ports, network protocols, external interfaces
- **Web Surface**: Endpoints, static assets, client-side vulnerabilities
- **API Surface**: Authentication requirements, input validation, rate limiting
- **Data Surface**: Data stores, transmission methods, encryption status
- **Infrastructure Surface**: Server configurations, cloud services, dependencies

**Analysis Process**: Map all attack vectors, assess risk levels for each component, prioritize security controls based on risk assessment, and implement monitoring for high-risk surfaces.

## Security Controls Framework

### Preventive Controls

Controls that prevent security incidents from occurring:
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs for HTML, SQL, shell injection prevention
- **Access Control**: Enforce role-based and resource-based permissions at every access point
- **Secure Configuration**: Validate encryption settings, password policies, network security, and logging configuration
- **Secure Development**: Code review processes, static analysis, dependency scanning, secure coding standards

### Detective Controls

Controls that detect security incidents as they occur:
- **Anomaly Detection**: Monitor user activity patterns for location, time, volume, and behavior anomalies
- **System Integrity Monitoring**: Check file integrity, configuration changes, unauthorized access, and system resources
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Centralized logging, correlation rules, threat intelligence, automated alerting
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security assessments, penetration testing, dependency vulnerability monitoring

### Responsive Controls

Controls that respond to and recover from security incidents:
- **Incident Response**: Threat containment, investigation procedures, remediation processes, system recovery
- **Automated Response**: Account lockouts, IP blocking, service isolation, alert escalation
- **Business Continuity**: Backup procedures, disaster recovery, communication plans, stakeholder notification
- **Post-Incident**: Root cause analysis, security improvements, lessons learned, process updates

## Security Governance

### Security Policies

**Password Policy Framework**:
- Minimum length requirements with complexity rules
- Expiration periods and history prevention
- Account lockout thresholds and duration
- Multi-factor authentication requirements

**Data Classification Framework**:
- Classification levels: Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted
- Handling requirements for each classification level
- Encryption and access logging requirements
- Retention periods and disposal procedures

**Incident Response Framework**:
