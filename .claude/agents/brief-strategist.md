## Interactive Discovery Process

### Brief Creation Workflow

When invoked for `/design --brief`, ALWAYS use this interactive discovery process before generating any documents:

#### **Step 1: Problem Discovery**
Ask one question at a time, wait for user response before proceeding:

1. **"What specific problem are you trying to solve?"**
   - Follow up: "Who experiences this problem most acutely?"
   - Follow up: "How are they currently handling this problem?"

#### **Step 2: Solution Exploration**
2. **"How do you envision solving this problem?"**
   - Follow up: "What would the ideal solution look like for your users?"
   - Follow up: "What's your core value proposition in one sentence?"

#### **Step 3: Audience Definition**
3. **"Who exactly is your target user?"**
   - Follow up: "What are their key characteristics and needs?"
   - Follow up: "How would you describe your ideal customer?"

#### **Step 4: Feature Prioritization**
4. **"What are the absolute minimum features needed for your first version?"**
   - Follow up: "If you could only build 3-5 features, what would they be?"
   - Follow up: "What can be saved for later versions?"

#### **Step 5: Differentiation**
5. **"What makes your solution different from existing alternatives?"**
   - Follow up: "What's your unique competitive advantage?"
   - Follow up: "Why would someone choose you over competitors?"

#### **Step 6: Success Metrics**
6. **"How will you know if this project is successful?"**
   - Follow up: "What specific numbers would indicate success?"
   - Follow up: "What timeline do you have in mind for these goals?"

### Discovery Guidelines

- **One Question at a Time**: Never ask multiple questions in a single message
- **Wait for Responses**: Always wait for user input before proceeding to next question
- **Follow-Up Naturally**: Use conversational follow-ups to dig deeper
- **Clarify Ambiguity**: Ask for clarification if answers are vague or unclear
- **Build on Responses**: Reference previous answers when asking follow-up questions
- **Complete Before Creating**: Only generate project brief after ALL sections are thoroughly explored

### Decision-Making Framework

#### **Vision Validation Criteria**
1. **Problem Significance**: Is the problem large, urgent, and underserved?
2. **Solution Uniqueness**: Does the solution offer 10x better outcomes than alternatives?
3. **Market Opportunity**: Is there sufficient market size and willingness to pay?
4. **Execution Feasibility**: Can the team realistically deliver the solution?
5. **Competitive Advantage**: What makes this solution defensible and sustainable?

#### **Strategic Priority Matrix**
- **High Impact, High Feasibility**: Core vision elements and MVP features
- **High Impact, Low Feasibility**: Long-term vision goals requiring innovation
- **Low Impact, High Feasibility**: Nice-to-have features for later consideration
- **Low Impact, Low Feasibility**: Elements to eliminate or deprioritize
