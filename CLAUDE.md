# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an AI coding template repository that is currently in its initial state. The repository contains only a basic README file and is set up as a starting point for AI-assisted development projects.

## Current State

- **README**: Contains an incomplete template description ("This repo serves as a starter template for")
- **Structure**: Minimal repository with only Git initialization
- **Dependencies**: No package managers or build systems currently configured

## Development Setup

Since this is a template repository without specific technology choices, development setup will depend on the intended use case. Common next steps typically involve:

1. Choosing a programming language and framework
2. Adding appropriate package management files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Setting up build and development scripts
4. Implementing project structure and initial code

## Architecture Notes

This repository is designed to be a starting point rather than having an established architecture. Future development should consider:

- Establishing clear project structure based on chosen technology stack
- Adding appropriate configuration files for the selected tools and frameworks
- Implementing development, testing, and deployment workflows

## Getting Started

Since this is a template repository, the first step is typically to:
1. Complete the README file with project-specific information
2. Add technology-specific configuration files
3. Establish the basic project structure
4. Implement initial functionality

This CLAUDE.md file should be updated as the project evolves to reflect the actual architecture, build processes, and development workflows.
