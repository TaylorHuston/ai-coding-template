## What is Context Engineering?

Context engineering has evolved beyond simple prompt engineering. It's about constructing an entire information environment so AI can solve problems reliably and consistently across long development sessions.

### Key Principles

1. **Quality over Quantity**: More closely matching examples lead to better results
2. **Strategic Information Placement**: Start/end positioning for important information
3. **Structured Context Boundaries**: Clear separation between different information types
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Building context incrementally as needed

### Context vs. Prompt Engineering

| Prompt Engineering | Context Engineering |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Focus on single interactions | Focus on entire development sessions |
| Clever phrasing of questions | Constructing information environments |
| One-shot optimization | Sustained consistency across interactions |

## Context Window Challenges

### Current Limitations (2024)

- **Standard Size**: 32K-128K tokens (~250-page book)
- **Attention Dilution**: Information in middle of context gets less attention
- **Cost Scaling**: Linear cost increase with context size
- **Performance Impact**: Larger contexts slow processing

### The "Lost in the Middle" Problem

LLMs struggle to maintain focus on details, especially information located in the middle of long contexts. Key strategies:

1. **Front-load critical information**
2. **End with immediate requirements** 
3. **Minimize irrelevant middle content**

## Memory Management Strategies

### 1. Context Garbage Collection

Regularly clean up your context, similar to memory management in programming:

```markdown
## Context Cleanup Session

### Keep (Essential Context)
- Current project structure
- Active feature requirements
- Key architectural decisions
- Error patterns and solutions

### Archive (Reference Only)
- Completed features
- Resolved bugs
- Old architectural discussions
- Historical decisions

### Remove (Outdated)
- Failed attempts
- Superseded requirements
- Irrelevant side discussions
- Obsolete code patterns
```

### 2. Context Layering

Structure information in layers of importance:

```markdown
## Layer 1: Immediate Context (Always Present)
- Current task and requirements
- Active code files
- Immediate constraints

## Layer 2: Project Context (Include When Relevant)
- Architecture overview
- Key patterns and conventions
- API contracts

## Layer 3: Reference Context (Include Only When Needed)
- Historical decisions
- Alternative approaches considered
- Related but inactive features
```

## Context Pruning and Refresh

### Regular Context Refresh Pattern

Every 10-15 interactions or when approaching context limits:

1. **Summarize Current State**
   ```markdown
   ## Progress Summary
   - Completed: [list achievements]
   - Current Focus: [active work]
   - Next Steps: [immediate priorities]
   - Decisions Made: [key choices]
   - Patterns Established: [conventions to maintain]
   ```

2. **Extract Key Context**
   - Active code patterns
   - Unresolved issues
   - Success patterns to repeat

3. **Start Fresh Session**
   - Begin with summary
   - Add only essential context
   - Reference full history if needed

### Context Templates

Create reusable templates for consistent context:

```markdown
## Project Context Template

### Tech Stack
- Framework: [Current framework]
- Language: [Version]
- Key Libraries: [Essential dependencies]

### Architecture Pattern
[Brief description of architecture]

### Current Sprint/Focus
- Goal: [What we're building]
- Success Criteria: [How we know it's done]
- Constraints: [Technical/business limitations]

### Code Conventions
[Link to examples or brief description]

### Known Issues
[Current blockers or technical debt]
```

## RAG Implementation for Codebases

### Code RAG Architecture

Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation for your codebase:

```markdown
## Code RAG Setup

### 1. Indexing Strategy
- **File-level**: Index entire files for small codebases
- **Function-level**: Index individual functions/classes
- **Semantic chunks**: Break large files into logical sections

### 2. Embedding Strategy
- Use code-specific embedding models
- Include comments and documentation
- Maintain metadata (file paths, dependencies)

### 3. Retrieval Process
- Vector similarity search for relevant code
- Keyword search for specific functions/classes
- Dependency-based retrieval for related components
```

### Chunking Strategies by File Type

#### Source Code Files
```python
# Chunk by functions/classes, include:
# - Function signature
# - Docstring
# - Dependencies/imports
# - Related context (class definition if method)
```

#### Documentation Files
```markdown
# Chunk by sections, include:
# - Section headers for context
# - Related code examples
# - Cross-references to other docs
```

#### Configuration Files
```yaml
# Chunk by logical groups:
# - Related configuration sections
# - Include comments explaining purpose
# - Dependencies between settings
```

### Two-Stage Retrieval

1. **Initial Retrieval**: Vector search for relevant content
2. **LLM Filtering**: Use AI to rank and filter results based on current task

```python
def two_stage_retrieval(query, codebase_index):
    # Stage 1: Vector similarity search
    candidates = vector_search(query, codebase_index, top_k=20)
    
    # Stage 2: LLM ranking and filtering
    relevant_context = llm_filter_and_rank(
        query=query,
        candidates=candidates,
        current_task_context=get_current_context(),
        max_results=5
    )
    
    return relevant_context
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Progressive Context Building

Build context incrementally rather than front-loading everything:

```markdown
## Session Start: Minimal Context
- Current task only
- Immediate requirements

## As Needed: Add Context Layers
- When AI asks for clarification → Add relevant background
- When patterns emerge → Include similar examples  
- When issues arise → Add relevant historical context
```

### Context State Management

Track context state throughout development:

```markdown
## Context State Tracker

### Session: [Session ID/Date]
### Context Budget: [Used/Total tokens]
### Context Quality Score: [Relevance rating]

### Active Context Modules:
- [ ] Project overview
- [ ] Current feature requirements  
- [ ] Architecture patterns
- [ ] Code examples
- [ ] Error handling patterns
- [ ] Testing patterns

### Context Health Indicators:
- Last refresh: [Timestamp]
- Relevance drift: [Low/Medium/High]
- Information density: [Efficient/Bloated]
```

### Context Compression Techniques

When approaching context limits:

```markdown
## Compression Strategies

### 1. Summarization
- Convert long discussions to key decisions
- Replace code examples with pattern descriptions
- Compress historical context to bullet points

### 2. Reference Links
- Replace inline code with file references
- Use "see examples/" instead of full code blocks
- Link to documentation rather than repeating

### 3. Essential-Only Mode
- Keep only current task context
- Remove all historical information
- Focus on immediate requirements only
```

### Context Handoff Between Sessions

When switching between AI tools or sessions:

```markdown
## Context Handoff Template

### Project State
- Current working directory: [Path]
- Active files: [List]
- Last successful action: [Description]

### Conversation Context
- Goal: [What we're trying to achieve]
- Progress: [What's been completed]
- Next step: [Immediate next action]
- Challenges: [Current blockers]

### Technical Context
- Patterns established: [Key conventions]
- Architecture decisions: [Important choices made]
- Dependencies: [External libraries/services]

### Code Quality Context
- Testing approach: [Current strategy]
- Error handling: [Established patterns]
- Performance considerations: [Known requirements]
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Regular Context Hygiene**: Clean up every 10-15 interactions
2. **Layer Information**: Structure by importance and relevance
3. **Front-load Critical Info**: Put key information at start and end
4. **Use Templates**: Consistent structure improves AI understanding
5. **Track Context Health**: Monitor relevance and information density
6. **Progressive Building**: Add context incrementally as needed
7. **Implement RAG**: For large codebases, use retrieval-augmented generation
8. **Plan for Handoffs**: Structure context for easy session transitions
