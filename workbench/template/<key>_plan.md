# <key> Plan

This should serve as a checklist-style plan of all the steps needed to accomplish this task. It should not contain any subjective data, assessments, etc. Just the concrete steps, so that you and the LLM are both always on the same page on exactly what is being worked on.

This should be broken into Phases, with each Phase roughly coinciding with a logical point to make a commit.

Use this when prompting the LLM. For example:

"Please have the TPM and test-builder agents coordinate on implementing 5.1"
