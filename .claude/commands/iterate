Iterative improvement workflow for progressive refinement:
1. Analyze current state and identify improvement opportunities

3. Implement incremental improvements in focused iterations
4. Validate improvements and measure progress
5. Continue iterating until quality targets are met

Process:
- Use context-analyzer to establish baseline state
- Use appropriate specialists to identify improvement areas
- Use project-manager to coordinate improvement iterations
- Implement improvements in small, focused batches
- Validate each iteration with quality checks
- Update progress tracking and metrics
- Continue until improvement goals are achieved

Parameters:
- --target: Specific improvement target (performance, quality, security)
- --iterations: Maximum number of iterations (default: 3)
- --threshold: Quality threshold to achieve
- --scope: Scope of improvements (file, module, project)
