# Project Status Command

Enhanced project status dashboard with intelligent analysis using context-analyzer agent and ai-status.sh integration.

## Usage

```bash
# Basic intelligent status report
/status

# AI-optimized format for assistants
/status --ai-format

# Enhanced with memory insights and personalization
/status --with-memory

# Detailed analysis with recommendations
/status --detailed

# Specific scope analysis
/status --scope git
/status --scope project
/status --scope environment

```

## Features

### Intelligent Context Analysis

Uses **context-analyzer** agent to provide deep insights beyond basic status:

- **Git Repository Analysis**: Branch strategy assessment, commit patterns, merge conflicts
- **Project Health Assessment**: Code quality trends, technical debt indicators
- **Workflow State Analysis**: Current workflow phase, task progress, blockers
- **Development Patterns**: Team productivity metrics, code review patterns
- **Environment Consistency**: Development environment validation, dependency issues

### Enhanced Status Dimensions

```yaml
status_dimensions:
  git_intelligence:
    basic: [branch, commits, status]
    enhanced: [branch_strategy_analysis, commit_pattern_insights, merge_conflict_prediction]
    agent: context-analyzer

  project_health:
    basic: [file_counts, directory_structure]
    enhanced: [code_quality_trends, technical_debt_assessment, architecture_health]
    agent: context-analyzer

  workflow_state:
    basic: [current_files, recent_changes]
    enhanced: [workflow_phase_analysis, task_progress_insights, blocker_identification]
    agent: context-analyzer

  environment_analysis:
    basic: [tools, dependencies]
    enhanced: [environment_consistency, dependency_vulnerability_assessment, toolchain_optimization]
    agent: context-analyzer

  development_insights:
    basic: [recent_activity]
    enhanced: [productivity_patterns, collaboration_insights, quality_trends]
    agent: context-analyzer
```

## Integration with ai-status.sh

Intelligently orchestrates the existing ai-status.sh script:

```yaml
script_integration:
  basic_data_collection:
    script: ai-status.sh
    purpose: "Gather raw project status data"

  intelligent_analysis:
    agent: context-analyzer
    purpose: "Analyze patterns and provide insights"

  enhanced_reporting:
    coordination: "Agent processes script output for intelligent insights"
    format_options: [human, ai-optimized, detailed, json]
```
