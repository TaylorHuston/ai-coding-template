# Initial Project Setup Deliverable

> **📌 NOTE: This is an EXAMPLE deliverable**
> Feel free to:
> - ✅ **USE IT**: Follow these setup tasks for a solid project foundation
> - 🗑️ **DELETE IT**: Remove this entire `001-initial-setup` directory if not needed
> - ✏️ **MODIFY IT**: Adapt the issues to your specific needs
>
> This deliverable demonstrates the template structure while providing genuinely useful setup tasks based on 2025 best practices.

## Overview

This deliverable contains all the essential setup tasks that should be completed when starting a new serious software project. These foundational elements ensure your project starts with professional standards, modern best practices, and sustainable development workflows.

## Why This Matters

Starting a project without proper setup leads to:
- Technical debt from day one
- Inconsistent code quality
- Missing observability when issues arise
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Painful onboarding for new developers
- Difficult maintenance and scaling

This deliverable ensures you build on a solid foundation following 2025 best practices.

## Issues Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (Day 1)
- [SETUP-001](./issues/SETUP-001/README.md) - Initialize Repository & Core Structure
- [SETUP-002](./issues/SETUP-002/README.md) - Establish Development Environment

### Phase 2: Quality & Testing (Day 2-3)
- [SETUP-003](./issues/SETUP-003/README.md) - Configure Testing Framework
- [SETUP-004](./issues/SETUP-004/README.md) - Set Up Linting & Code Quality

### Phase 3: Operations & Security (Day 3-4)
- [SETUP-005](./issues/SETUP-005/README.md) - Implement Observability & Logging
- [SETUP-006](./issues/SETUP-006/README.md) - Establish Security & Dependency Management

### Phase 4: Automation & Process (Day 4-5)
- [SETUP-007](./issues/SETUP-007/README.md) - Configure CI/CD Pipeline
- [SETUP-008](./issues/SETUP-008/README.md) - Create Documentation Foundation
- [SETUP-009](./issues/SETUP-009/README.md) - Establish Development Processes

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository and navigate to this deliverable
2. Work through issues in order (they build on each other)
3. Each issue contains:
   - Clear objectives and acceptance criteria
   - Step-by-step implementation guide
   - Templates and examples
   - Verification steps
4. Customize based on your tech stack and requirements

## Success Criteria

✅ All 9 setup issues completed  
✅ Development environment reproducible  
✅ Testing framework operational  
✅ CI/CD pipeline running  
✅ Observability implemented  
✅ Security scanning active  
✅ Documentation foundation in place  
✅ Team processes defined  

## Tech Stack Adaptations

While examples use JavaScript/Node.js, adapt for your stack:

| JavaScript | Python | Java | Go | Rust |
|------------|--------|------|----|----|
| npm/yarn | pip/poetry | maven/gradle | go mod | cargo |
| ESLint | pylint/black | Checkstyle | golangci-lint | clippy |
| Jest | pytest | JUnit | go test | cargo test |
| prettier | black | google-java-format | gofmt | rustfmt |

## Time Estimates

| Issue | Estimated Time | Complexity |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| SETUP-001 | 1-2 hours | Low |
| SETUP-002 | 2-3 hours | Medium |
| SETUP-003 | 2-4 hours | Medium |
| SETUP-004 | 1-2 hours | Low |
| SETUP-005 | 3-4 hours | High |
| SETUP-006 | 2-3 hours | Medium |
| SETUP-007 | 3-4 hours | High |
| SETUP-008 | 2-3 hours | Medium |
| SETUP-009 | 1-2 hours | Low |
| **Total** | **17-27 hours** | **Mixed** |
