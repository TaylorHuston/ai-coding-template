## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project uses the [AI Coding Template](./docs/ai-tools/template-documentation.md) workflow for intelligent, context-aware development.

### Key Directories

- `src/` - {{SOURCE_DESCRIPTION}}
- `docs/` - Project documentation
- `docs/ai-tools/` - AI-assisted development guides and templates
- `scripts/` - Automation and development scripts
- `.claude/` - AI agent configurations and commands

### AI-Assisted Development

This project includes intelligent development workflows:

- **`/feature`** - Feature requirements and context creation
- **`/architect`** - Technical architecture and decision design
- **`/plan`** - Multi-agent planning and task breakdown
- **`/develop`** - Context-aware task execution with quality gates

See [Getting Started with AI Workflow](./docs/ai-tools/getting-started-with-template.md) for details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

This project uses AI-assisted development for consistent, high-quality results:

1. **Define** - Use `/feature` to create feature requirements and context
2. **Design** - Use `/architect` to create technical architecture and decisions
3. **Plan** - Use `/plan` to create detailed implementation roadmaps
4. **Execute** - Use `/develop` to implement with context-aware quality gates
5. **Validate** - Use `/quality` to ensure standards compliance

See [AI Collaboration Guide](./docs/ai-tools/guides/ai-collaboration-guide.md) for best practices.

## ü§ù Contributing

### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Use AI workflow: `/feature "amazing feature approach"` ‚Üí `/architect` ‚Üí `/plan` ‚Üí `/develop`
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"`
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/amazing-feature`
6. Open a Pull Request

### Development Standards
- Follow the AI-assisted development workflow
- All features must include comprehensive tests
- Update documentation for user-facing changes
- Use conventional commit messages

See [Contributing Guidelines](./docs/development/guidelines/contributing.md) for details.
