# Issue Plan - SETUP-002

**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Type**: Setup/Configuration  
**Status**: Planning  
**External Ticket**: N/A  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../README.md)  

## Issue Summary

Establish a consistent, reproducible development environment using Docker, EditorConfig, and IDE configurations to eliminate "works on my machine" problems and accelerate team onboarding.

## User Story

As a developer, I want a standardized development environment so that I can quickly set up my workspace and maintain consistency with the team.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 - Setup & Foundation

- [ ] Review existing development setup (if any)
- [ ] Identify technology stack requirements
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Document environment requirements

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation

- [ ] Create EditorConfig file
  - [ ] Configure for all file types
  - [ ] Set line endings and indentation
- [ ] Set up Docker environment
  - [ ] Create docker-compose.yml
  - [ ] Create Dockerfile.dev
  - [ ] Configure services (database, cache)
- [ ] Configure IDE settings
  - [ ] VS Code settings.json
  - [ ] Extensions recommendations
  - [ ] Debug configurations

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality

- [ ] Test Docker setup on fresh environment
- [ ] Verify cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Test all development scripts
- [ ] Ensure <30 minute setup time

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish

- [ ] Create development setup guide
- [ ] Document troubleshooting steps
- [ ] Add environment variables documentation
- [ ] Create quick start scripts

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment

- [ ] Self-review all configurations
- [ ] Test on team member's machine
- [ ] Address feedback
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Technical Approach

Use Docker Compose for service orchestration with separate configurations for development. Implement EditorConfig for code consistency and provide IDE-specific configurations for popular editors.

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **Blocking**: SETUP-001 (Repository initialization)
- **Requires**: Docker, Node.js, Git

### Risks
- Platform differences (Windows/Mac/Linux): Mitigate with cross-platform testing
- Docker performance on Mac: Document alternative local setup

## Changelog Entry

**Type**: Added  
**Description**: Development environment configuration with Docker and IDE settings  
**Breaking Change**: No  

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Environment setup tested on all platforms
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Setup time under 30 minutes
- [ ] Team reviewed and approved
