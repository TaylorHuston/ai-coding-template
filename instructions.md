4. **Check Dependencies**: Verify all prerequisites are met

### During Implementation
1. **Follow the Steps**: Work through the implementation phases in order
2. **Maintain Quality**: Ensure each quality gate is met before proceeding
3. **Ask Questions**: Don't assume - ask for clarification when unsure
4. **Document Progress**: Update status and note any deviations from plan

### Communication Protocol
1. **Confirm Understanding**: "I understand that I need to [summarize task]"
