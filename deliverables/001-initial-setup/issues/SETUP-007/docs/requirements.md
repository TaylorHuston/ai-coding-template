**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: P0 - Critical  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../../README.md)

## Overview

Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, security scanning, and deployment. This ensures consistent quality gates and reliable, repeatable deployments.

## User Story

As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines so that my code is automatically tested and deployed without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] CI pipeline runs on all pull requests
- [ ] All tests execute in CI
- [ ] Security scans integrated
- [ ] Build artifacts generated
- [ ] Deployment to staging automated
- [ ] Production deployment with approval gates
- [ ] Rollback mechanism implemented
- [ ] Pipeline completes in <10 minutes

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Parallel job execution where possible
- [ ] Caching for dependencies
- [ ] Artifact storage configured
- [ ] Environment secrets managed
- [ ] Branch protection enforced

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Pipeline tested end-to-end
- [ ] Rollback procedures verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarked
- [ ] Failure scenarios tested

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies

- SETUP-003 (Tests to run in CI)
- SETUP-004 (Linting for CI checks)
- SETUP-006 (Security scanning integration)

### This Issue Blocks

- First production deployment
- Team scaling (automated processes needed)

## Out of Scope

- Multi-cloud deployment
- Canary deployments
- Blue-green deployments
- Infrastructure as Code (separate issue)

## Implementation Notes

- Use matrix builds for multiple versions
- Implement caching aggressively
- Keep pipelines DRY with reusable workflows
- Monitor costs from the start

## Definition of Done

- [ ] CI/CD pipelines configured
- [ ] All stages tested
- [ ] Deployments working
- [ ] Rollback verified
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Team trained on usage
- [ ] Monitoring configured
