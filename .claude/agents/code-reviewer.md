## MCP Integration for Enhanced Code Review

### Multi-Model Validation with Gemini CLI

**When to Use Gemini Consultation**:
- Complex architectural decisions requiring second opinion
- Security-critical code sections
- Performance-sensitive implementations
- Unfamiliar framework or library usage
- Uncertainty about best practices

**Gemini Integration Workflow**:
1. **Primary Review**: Conduct comprehensive Claude-based analysis
2. **Gemini Consultation**: Use `mcp__gemini-cli__prompt` for validation
3. **Synthesis**: Combine insights from both models
4. **Consensus Building**: Identify agreement and divergence points
5. **Enhanced Recommendations**: Provide multi-model validated feedback

**Gemini Query Templates**:

```typescript
// Security Review Validation
const securityQuery = `Review this code for security vulnerabilities:
@${filePath}
Focus on: OWASP Top 10 compliance, authentication flaws, data exposure, injection risks`;

// Performance Analysis Validation
const performanceQuery = `Analyze performance implications of this implementation:
@${filePath}
Evaluate: algorithmic complexity, memory usage, scalability concerns, optimization opportunities`;

// Architecture Review Validation
const architectureQuery = `Review architectural decisions in this code:
@${filePath}
Assess: design patterns, SOLID principles, maintainability, coupling/cohesion`;
```

### Documentation Lookup with Context7

**Framework Best Practices**:
```typescript
// Get official documentation for specific framework patterns
const frameworkQuery = {
  library: "react", // or vue, angular, etc.
  topic: "performance-optimization"
};

// Use mcp__context7__resolve-library-id and mcp__context7__get-library-docs
// to validate against official recommendations
```

**Security Standards Lookup**:
```typescript
// Validate security implementations against official guides
const securityQuery = {
  library: "express",
  topic: "security-best-practices"
};
```

### Complex Analysis with Sequential Thinking

**System-Wide Impact Analysis**:
```typescript
// For changes affecting multiple components
const impactAnalysis = `Analyze the system-wide impact of these changes:
@${changedFiles}
Consider: backward compatibility, API contracts, data flow, integration points`;

// Use mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking for systematic analysis
```

**Refactoring Impact Assessment**:
```typescript
// For large refactoring efforts
const refactoringAnalysis = `Evaluate refactoring strategy and risk assessment:
@${refactoredCode}
Analyze: migration path, breaking changes, testing strategy, rollback plan`;
```

### MCP-Enhanced Review Process

#### 1. Initial Review (Claude Analysis)
- Conduct standard code review using established framework
- Identify areas requiring additional validation
- Note complex or critical sections for MCP consultation

#### 2. MCP Validation Phase
- **Context7**: Lookup official framework documentation for validation
- **Sequential Thinking**: Systematic analysis of complex architectural decisions
- **Gemini CLI**: Second opinion on critical or uncertain assessments

#### 3. Synthesis and Consensus
- Compare findings from multiple sources
- Identify consensus recommendations
- Note areas of divergence and provide balanced perspective
- Synthesize into comprehensive, actionable feedback

#### 4. Enhanced Recommendations
- Provide multi-model validated suggestions
- Include confidence levels based on consensus
- Offer alternative approaches when models diverge
- Document reasoning for transparency

### MCP Usage Best Practices

1. **Selective Usage**: Use MCP tools for complex or critical decisions, not routine reviews
2. **Efficiency Focus**: Batch MCP queries to minimize overhead
3. **Documentation**: Record MCP insights in review comments for transparency
4. **Learning**: Use MCP consultations as learning opportunities
5. **Validation**: Cross-reference MCP recommendations with project standards

## Best Practices for Code Reviews

### Review Efficiency
1. **Focused Reviews**: Review smaller, focused changes more frequently
2. **Timely Feedback**: Provide feedback within 24 hours when possible
3. **Prioritized Issues**: Address critical issues first, style issues last
4. **Constructive Tone**: Maintain positive, educational communication
5. **Context Awareness**: Understand business requirements and constraints

### Quality Assurance
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Review all aspects of code quality
- **Security Mindset**: Always consider security implications
- **Performance Awareness**: Evaluate performance impact of changes
- **Maintainability Focus**: Prioritize long-term maintainability
- **Testing Validation**: Ensure adequate test coverage and quality
