# Planning Analysis - [ISSUE-KEY]

**Issue**: [ISSUE-KEY] - [Brief Title]
**Planning Date**: [Date]
**Agents**: [List of agents that will contribute]

## Overview

Sequential planning session where each agent reads previous findings and adds their analysis. This builds comprehensive context for intelligent plan generation.

## CRITICAL_CONTEXT

*Non-negotiable findings that all agents must consider*

### Vision Alignment
- **Problem Statement**: [From vision document - what problem are we solving]
- **Target Audience**: [From vision document - who we're building for]
- **Success Metrics**: [From vision document - how we measure success]
- **Key Differentiators**: [From vision document - what makes this unique]

### Architecture Decisions
- [Fundamental architectural choices that constrain implementation]

### Security Requirements
- [Security constraints that cannot be compromised]

### Performance Constraints
- [Performance requirements that must be met]

### Integration Requirements
- [External system dependencies and API contracts]

### Technical Standards
- [Coding patterns, frameworks, and conventions that must be followed]
