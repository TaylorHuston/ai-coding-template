# Code Review Guidelines

**Purpose**: Comprehensive code review processes, checklists, and best practices for maintaining code quality and effective collaboration in AI-assisted development.

## Code Review Philosophy

### **Quality Assurance**

- Code reviews are quality gates, not just approvals
- Focus on maintainability, security, and performance
- Ensure adherence to project standards and patterns
- Validate AI-generated code meets human standards

### **Knowledge Sharing**

- Share expertise and best practices across the team
- Provide learning opportunities for junior developers
- Maintain consistency in coding approaches
- Document architectural decisions and patterns

### **Collaborative Improvement**

- Constructive feedback focused on code, not person
- Balance perfectionism with pragmatic delivery
- Encourage questions and alternative approaches
- Foster a culture of continuous improvement

- **Medium PRs** (200-500 lines): 1-2 reviewers, 24-48 hour turnaround
- **Large PRs** (> 500 lines): Multiple reviewers, staged review process

#### **Review Prioritization**

### **Measuring Review Effectiveness**

#### **Quality Metrics**

- **Defect Detection Rate**: Issues caught in review vs. production
