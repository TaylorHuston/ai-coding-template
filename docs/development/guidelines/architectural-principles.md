# Architectural Principles

**Purpose**: Foundational architectural principles that guide all development decisions and serve as the philosophical foundation for all other guidelines.

## Overview

These architectural principles form the bedrock of all development work. Every code decision, design choice, and implementation strategy should align with these fundamental principles. They provide the "why" behind the "what" in all other guidelines.

## Core Principles Hierarchy

### Foundation Layer: KISS Principle
*Keep It Simple, Stupid*

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Every solution should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.

**KISS Decision Framework**:
1. **Can this be solved with existing language features?** (Prefer built-ins over libraries)
2. **Would a junior developer understand this in 6 months?** (Optimize for readability)
3. **Does this solve the actual problem?** (Avoid solving imaginary problems)
4. **Can this be explained in plain English in under 30 seconds?** (Complexity indicator)

**Implementation Strategy**: Always start with the simplest solution that works, then add complexity only when proven necessary.

### Building Layer: DRY Principle
*Don't Repeat Yourself*

Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

**What Constitutes Repetition**:
- Logic repetition (not just code duplication)
- Multiple sources of truth for configuration
- Repeated business rules across components
- Duplicate validation patterns

**DRY at Different Levels**:
1. **Code Level**: Extract common functions and utilities
2. **Data Level**: Single source of truth for configuration
3. **Logic Level**: Centralize business rules
4. **Knowledge Level**: Documentation and requirements in one place

**DRY Violation Indicators**:
- Copy-paste programming between modules
- Similar conditional logic in multiple places
- Duplicate validation rules
- Repeated configuration patterns
- Multiple sources of truth for the same data

### Constraint Layer: YAGNI Principle
*You Aren't Gonna Need It*

Don't implement functionality until you actually need it.

**YAGNI Decision Framework**:
1. **Is this feature required by current specifications?**
2. **Do we have evidence this optimization is needed?**
3. **Will this complexity pay for itself within the current development cycle?**
4. **Can we measure the actual need for this feature?**

**When YAGNI Doesn't Apply**:
- Security considerations (better safe than compromised)
- Data integrity constraints (corruption is expensive)
- Basic error handling (exceptions will happen)
- Essential logging (debugging requires visibility)

**Implementation Strategy**: Build what you need now, add caching when performance becomes an actual problem, add features when requirements specify them.

### Structure Layer: SOLID Principles

#### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
*A class should have one, and only one, reason to change*

**Core Concept**: Each class or module should have responsibility for a single part of the functionality, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.

**Implementation Guidelines**: Separate user data management, validation logic, persistence, and external service integration into distinct classes with focused responsibilities.

#### O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
*Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification*

**Core Concept**: Design systems that can be extended with new functionality without modifying existing code that already works and is tested.

**Implementation Strategy**: Use abstractions and dependency injection to enable extension through new implementations rather than modification of existing classes.

#### L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
*Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking functionality*

**Core Concept**: Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.

**Implementation Guidelines**: Design proper abstraction hierarchies where subclasses maintain the behavioral contracts of their parent classes.

#### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
*Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface*

**Core Concept**: Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces they do not use. Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.

**Implementation Strategy**: Create focused, cohesive interfaces that serve specific client needs rather than monolithic interfaces with unrelated methods.

#### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
*Depend on abstractions, not on concretions*

**Core Concept**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details.

**Implementation Approach**: Use dependency injection and interface-based design to decouple high-level business logic from low-level implementation details.

## Principle Interaction and Trade-offs

### When Principles Conflict

**DRY vs YAGNI Scenarios**: When you have two similar but distinct functions, accept minor duplication until a clear pattern emerges. Apply the "Rule of Three" - refactor to DRY when you have three or more similar implementations.

**KISS vs SOLID Balance**: Start with simple solutions, then apply SOLID principles as the system grows in complexity. Don't over-engineer simple problems.

### Principle Application Priority

1. **KISS First**: If it's not simple, the other principles don't matter
2. **SOLID Structure**: Once simple, organize properly
3. **DRY Refinement**: Remove duplication after structure is clear
4. **YAGNI Constraint**: Only build what you actually need

### Architectural Decision Framework

For every significant code decision, ask:

1. **KISS**: Is this the simplest solution that works?
2. **SRP**: Does this class/function have a single reason to change?
3. **DRY**: Am I repeating logic or knowledge?
4. **YAGNI**: Do I need this feature now?
5. **OCP**: Can I extend this without modifying existing code?
6. **LSP**: Can I substitute implementations without breaking behavior?
7. **ISP**: Are my interfaces focused and cohesive?
8. **DIP**: Am I depending on abstractions rather than concretions?

## AI Assistant Guidelines

### Principle-Driven Code Generation

When generating code, AI assistants should:

1. **Start Simple**: Always propose the simplest solution first
2. **Question Complexity**: Ask "Is this complexity necessary?" before implementing
3. **Identify Repetition**: Actively look for DRY opportunities
4. **Challenge Features**: Question if proposed features are actually needed
5. **Apply SOLID**: Structure code following SOLID principles by default

### Code Review Integration

During code review, specifically check for architectural principle violations including unnecessary complexity, duplicated logic, premature features, mixed responsibilities, and tight coupling.

## Quality Indicators

### Good Architecture Signs
- Easy to understand and explain
- Simple to modify and extend
- Clear separation of concerns
- Minimal coupling between components
- High cohesion within components

### Architecture Warning Signs
- Long parameter lists indicating poor abstraction
- Deep inheritance hierarchies suggesting over-engineering
- Large classes or functions violating SRP
- Circular dependencies indicating design problems
- High cognitive complexity making code hard to understand

## Best Practices

### Architectural Implementation Process
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the most straightforward solution
2. **Apply Principles**: Use architectural principles to guide design decisions
3. **Refactor Gradually**: Improve architecture incrementally as understanding grows
4. **Review Continuously**: Regular architecture reviews to ensure principle adherence
5. **Document Decisions**: Record architectural decisions and rationale

### Principle Adherence
- **Consistency**: Apply principles consistently across the codebase
- **Balance**: Consider trade-offs between different principles
- **Evolution**: Allow architecture to evolve while maintaining principle alignment
- **Pragmatism**: Apply principles pragmatically based on project context and constraints
