# Issue Plan - SETUP-004

**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Type**: Setup/Configuration  
**Status**: Planning  
**External Ticket**: N/A  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../README.md)  

## Issue Summary

Implement automated code quality tools including linters, formatters, and pre-commit hooks to maintain consistent code style and catch issues early in the development process.

## User Story

As a developer, I want automated code quality checks so that I can maintain consistent code standards and reduce code review friction.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 - Setup & Foundation

- [ ] Review team code style preferences
- [ ] Research linting tools for tech stack
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Document code standards

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation

- [ ] Install and configure linters
  - [ ] ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript
  - [ ] Language-specific linters
  - [ ] Security linters
- [ ] Configure code formatters
  - [ ] Prettier or equivalent
  - [ ] EditorConfig integration
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks
  - [ ] Install Husky
  - [ ] Configure lint-staged
  - [ ] Add commit message validation

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality

- [ ] Test all linting rules
- [ ] Verify pre-commit hooks work
- [ ] Fix existing code violations
- [ ] Test editor integrations

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish

- [ ] Document code standards
- [ ] Create style guide
- [ ] Add linting commands to README
- [ ] Document bypass procedures

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment

- [ ] Team review of rules
- [ ] Adjust based on feedback
- [ ] Apply to entire codebase
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Technical Approach

Use ESLint with Prettier for JavaScript/TypeScript projects, with Husky for git hooks and lint-staged for performance. Configure rules to match team standards while allowing emergency bypasses.

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **Blocking**: SETUP-001 (Repository initialization)
- **Requires**: Package manager, Git

### Risks
- Too strict rules causing friction: Start with recommended, adjust based on team feedback
- Performance impact on commits: Use lint-staged to only check changed files

## Changelog Entry

**Type**: Added  
**Description**: Code quality tooling with ESLint, Prettier, and pre-commit hooks  
**Breaking Change**: No  

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All linters configured and working
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks functional
- [ ] Existing code passes all checks
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Team approved rule set
- [ ] Editor integrations documented
