# Issue Plan - SETUP-005

**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Type**: Setup/Configuration  
**Status**: Planning  
**External Ticket**: N/A  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../README.md)  

## Issue Summary

Implement comprehensive observability using OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, metrics, and structured logging to enable proactive monitoring and faster debugging.

## User Story

As a developer/operator, I want comprehensive observability so that I can monitor application health, debug issues quickly, and optimize performance.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 - Setup & Foundation

- [ ] Research observability requirements
- [ ] Choose observability stack components
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Plan metrics and traces

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation

- [ ] Install OpenTelemetry SDK
  - [ ] Configure tracing
  - [ ] Set up metrics collection
  - [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Set up local observability stack
  - [ ] Configure Jaeger for traces
  - [ ] Set up Prometheus for metrics
  - [ ] Configure Grafana for visualization
- [ ] Implement error tracking
  - [ ] Configure Sentry or similar
  - [ ] Set up error alerting

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality

- [ ] Generate test telemetry data
- [ ] Verify traces are connected
- [ ] Test metrics collection
- [ ] Validate dashboards work

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish

- [ ] Document observability setup
- [ ] Create runbooks for common issues
- [ ] Document dashboard usage
- [ ] Add telemetry guidelines

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment

- [ ] Review telemetry completeness
- [ ] Optimize performance impact
- [ ] Create initial dashboards
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Technical Approach

Implement OpenTelemetry as the vendor-neutral standard for observability, with local development stack using open-source tools (Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana).

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **Blocking**: SETUP-002 (Services must be running)
- **Requires**: Docker for observability stack

### Risks
- Performance overhead: Implement sampling and async collection
- Data volume: Set retention policies and aggregation

## Changelog Entry
