# CLAUDE.md - AI Agent Instructions

**Version**: 1.0.0 **Created**: 2025-08-21 **Last Updated**: 2025-08-22 **Status**: Active **Target Audience**: AI Assistants

You are working with an AI coding template repository designed to optimize AI-assisted development workflows. Follow these instructions precisely when operating in this codebase.

## Critical Rules

1. **Commit Approval:** Never commit without explicit user approval first
2. **Comment Approval:** Never comment on <Jira/Linear/etc> without explicit user approval first
3. **No Assumptions**: Always check existing patterns and code, run tests, ask user if any ambiguity
4. **Test First:** Follow strict TDD guidelines
5. **Branch First:** Never work directly on main branches (see [AI Branching Strategy](./docs/guides/ai-branching-strategy.md))
6. **Atomic Commits:** Keep commits small and focused
7. **Ask Questions Often and Early**: Clarify ambiguity before implementation
8. **Reindex Documentation**: Reindex all /docs/\* files after each major action
9. **Keep Knowledge Current**: Before starting a new batch of work read all feature files and any relevant Context7 documentation

## AI Autonomy Matrix

| Action             | Permission    | Example                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Read/Analyze**   | ‚úÖ Autonomous | Reading files, analyzing code, searching  |
| **Plan/Test**      | ‚úÖ Autonomous | Creating plans, running tests, validation |
| **Code Changes**   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Show First | Display changes before applying           |
| **Commits/Merges** | üõë Always Ask | Never commit without explicit approval    |
| **Deletions**      | üõë Always Ask | Any file/branch deletions need approval   |

## Core Operating Principles

**ALWAYS** read the following files BEFORE beginning any work:

1. `STATUS.md` - Current project state and progress
2. `deliverables/[DELIVERABLE]/issues/[ISSUE]/PLAN.md` - Active task instructions and workflows (if working on a specific issue)
3. `docs/technical.md` - System architecture and technical specifications

**NEVER** begin work without understanding the current project context.

## Response Protocol

You MUST follow these behavioral guidelines:

- **Be Concise**: Show code/commands, explain only when asked
- **Be Explicit**: Confirm understanding before major changes
- **Be Incremental**: Work in small, atomic commits
- **Be Transparent**: Report errors immediately with context
- **Be Evidence-Based**: Support decisions with verifiable information

## File Naming Requirements

You MUST follow these naming conventions:

- **Documentation files**: Use `lowercase-kebab-case` exclusively (e.g., `authentication-guide.md`)
- **Code files**: Follow the naming conventions for the specific programming language
- **No exceptions**: Enforce these conventions in all file operations

## Context Management Protocol

### Session Startup Checklist

1. Read `STATUS.md` to understand current project state
2. Check `deliverables/[DELIVERABLE]/issues/[ISSUE]/PLAN.md` for active task instructions (if working on a specific issue)
3. Review `docs/technical.md` for relevant technical context
4. Confirm understanding of current context before proceeding
5. Update your understanding based on these context files

### Context Preservation Requirements

- Use status management files to maintain context efficiently
- Reference files by name rather than including full content unnecessarily
- Focus on current task context rather than entire project history
- Prune outdated information from conversations
- Always preserve essential context for session handoffs

### Session Completion Protocol

1. Update `STATUS.md` with current progress and achievements
2. Update `deliverables/[DELIVERABLE]/issues/[ISSUE]/PLAN.md` with task progress and next steps (if working on a specific issue)
3. **Update CHANGELOG.md**: Add entries for completed features, fixes, or changes under `[Unreleased]` section
4. Document any important decisions or changes made
5. Prepare clear context for the next session handoff
6. Ensure all context files accurately reflect current state

## Session Initialization Protocol

### Quick Status Assessment

Before beginning any work session:

1. **Check for blockers**: Scan `STATUS.md` and active issue PLAN.md files for urgent issues
2. **Assess current work**: Review active tasks and progress
3. **Check next priorities**: Identify upcoming work if no active tasks
4. **Ask for direction**: Request user instruction if status is unclear

### What You Should Suggest (But Wait for Approval)

- **Blockers found**: "Found urgent issues. Should we address [specific issue] first?"
- **Active work**: "Current work shows [details]. Continue with this work?"
- **Ready for new work**: "Status looks clear. What would you like to work on?"

**Key**: Always suggest based on actual conditions but wait for user instruction before proceeding.

## 17-Agent Framework Integration

You have access to 17 specialized agents through the `.claude/agents/` directory. Use these agents appropriately:

### Automatically Invoked Agents (8 agents)

These activate automatically based on context:

- **project-manager**: Multi-domain tasks requiring coordination
- **context-analyzer**: Investigation and root cause analysis tasks
- **frontend-specialist**: UI/UX development and component work
- **backend-specialist**: Server-side implementation and business logic
- **database-specialist**: All database-related operations
- **test-engineer**: Test creation and strategy development
- **code-reviewer**: Post-implementation quality reviews
- **docs-sync-agent**: After code changes affecting documentation

### On-Demand Specialists (9 agents)

Invoke these for specific needs:

- **code-architect**: Architectural decisions and system design
- **api-designer**: API architecture and endpoint design
- **security-auditor**: Security audits and compliance validation
- **devops-engineer**: Infrastructure and deployment automation
- **performance-optimizer**: Performance analysis and optimization
- **technical-writer**: New documentation creation
- **refactoring-specialist**: Code improvement and technical debt reduction
- **migration-specialist**: Version upgrades and framework migrations
- **data-analyst**: Data processing, analysis, and reporting

### Agent Selection Rules

- Match agent expertise to specific task domains
- Use appropriate model complexity (haiku/sonnet/opus) for task requirements
- Plan coordination procedures for multi-agent workflows
- Monitor agent effectiveness and optimize selection patterns

## Tool Selection Guide

Use these tools appropriately for different tasks:

```yaml
Search:
  - Grep: For specific patterns and content

2. **Inconsistent patterns**: Check existing code patterns before implementing
3. **Lost session context**: Follow session completion protocol properly

### File and Permission Issues

1. **Permission denied on scripts**: Run `chmod +x scripts/*.sh`
2. **File not found errors**: Use absolute paths and verify file existence
3. **Git conflicts**: Always create feature branches, never work on main

### Tool and Agent Issues

1. **Agent not responding as expected**: Be explicit about agent requests
2. **Tool selection confusion**: Reference the Tool Selection Guide above
3. **MCP server failures**: Fall back to native Claude tools

### Code Quality Issues

1. **Tests failing**: Run full test suite before committing changes
2. **Linting errors**: Follow existing project formatting standards
3. **Documentation out of sync**: Use docs-sync-agent after code changes

### General Troubleshooting

1. **When in doubt**: Ask the user rather than making assumptions
2. **Complex problems**: Use appropriate specialized agent
3. **Multiple issues**: Address P0/critical issues first
