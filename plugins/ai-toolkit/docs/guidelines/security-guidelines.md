## Core Security Principles

### Principle of Least Privilege
**Core Concept**: Users, applications, and systems should have only the minimum access necessary to perform their functions.

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Grant minimal required permissions for specific operations
- Use temporary permissions with automatic expiration
- Implement regular permission auditing and cleanup
- Justify all permission grants with business requirements
- Automate permission lifecycle management

**Key Benefits**: Reduces attack surface, limits blast radius of compromised accounts, ensures compliance with access control requirements.

### Defense in Depth
**Core Concept**: Multiple layers of security controls to protect against various attack vectors. No single security measure should be relied upon.

**Security Layers**:
- **Network Layer**: Firewalls, intrusion detection, DDoS protection, network segmentation
- **Application Layer**: Input validation, output encoding, CSRF protection, rate limiting
- **Authentication Layer**: Multi-factor authentication, password policies, session management
- **Authorization Layer**: Role-based access, attribute-based access, resource permissions
- **Data Layer**: Encryption at rest and in transit, data classification, backup security
- **Monitoring Layer**: Security logging, anomaly detection, threat intelligence, incident response

**Strategy**: Each layer should be independent and provide protection even if other layers fail. Design for redundancy and overlapping controls.

### Zero Trust Architecture
**Core Concept**: Never trust, always verify - assume no implicit trust based on network location or previous authentication.

**Zero Trust Principles**:
- **Verify Explicitly**: Always authenticate and authorize based on available data points
- **Least Privileged Access**: Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access principles
- **Assume Breach**: Minimize blast radius and segment access to verify end-to-end encryption

**Verification Framework**:
- **Identity Verification**: Continuous authentication, multi-factor validation, behavioral analysis
- **Device Verification**: Device compliance, trust scoring, certificate-based authentication
- **Network Verification**: Micro-segmentation, encrypted connections, traffic inspection
- **Application Verification**: Application-layer security, API security, code integrity
- **Data Verification**: Data classification, encryption, access logging, loss prevention

**Trust Scoring**: Combine verification results into weighted trust scores that determine access levels and additional security controls.

### Fail Secure
**Core Concept**: When systems fail, they should fail to a secure state rather than an open state. Default to denying access when in doubt.

**Implementation Principles**:
- **Default Deny**: Access should be explicitly granted, never assumed
- **Error Handling**: Any system errors should result in access denial
- **Graceful Degradation**: Maintain security even when dependent services fail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Log all failures for security monitoring and analysis
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Design secure fallbacks for critical system failures

## Modern Security Considerations

### Supply Chain Security
**Core Concept**: Secure the entire software supply chain from development to deployment to prevent malicious code injection and unauthorized modifications.

**Supply Chain Protection**:
- **Dependency Management**: Pin dependency versions, verify checksums, monitor for vulnerabilities
- **Code Provenance**: Sign commits, verify contributor identity, maintain audit trails
- **Build Security**: Secure build environments, reproducible builds, artifact signing
- **Third-Party Risk**: Vendor security assessments, SLA security requirements, exit strategies

**Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**:
- Document all software components and dependencies
- Track component versions and known vulnerabilities
- Automate SBOM generation and distribution
- Monitor for security advisories and updates

### Container and Deployment Security
**Container Security Principles**:
- **Minimal Base Images**: Use distroless or minimal base images, remove unnecessary packages
- **Image Scanning**: Scan for vulnerabilities, malware, and misconfigurations before deployment
- **Runtime Security**: Monitor container behavior, detect anomalies, enforce security policies
- **Secret Management**: Never embed secrets in images, use external secret management systems

**Deployment Security**:
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define security configurations declaratively, version control all changes
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Replace rather than update, maintain consistent security posture
- **Secure Defaults**: Apply security hardening by default, minimize manual configuration
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate development, staging, and production environments

### Security Testing Integration
**Shift-Left Security Testing**:
- **IDE Integration**: Real-time security feedback during development
- **Pre-Commit Hooks**: Automated security checks before code commits
- **Pull Request Security**: Automated security review for all code changes
- **Development Training**: Security awareness integrated into developer workflows

**Automated Security Testing**:
- **SAST Integration**: Static analysis in CI/CD pipelines with quality gates
- **DAST Automation**: Dynamic testing for runtime vulnerabilities
- **SCA (Software Composition Analysis)**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **IaC Security**: Infrastructure configuration security validation

## Threat Modeling

### STRIDE Methodology
Systematic approach to identifying security threats:
- **Spoofing**: Identity verification attacks, impersonation threats
- **Tampering**: Unauthorized data modification, integrity violations
- **Repudiation**: Denying actions performed, non-repudiation failures
- **Information Disclosure**: Unauthorized data access, privacy breaches
- **Denial of Service**: System availability attacks, resource exhaustion
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Unauthorized access escalation, privilege abuse

### Attack Surface Analysis
**Surface Components**:
- **Network Surface**: Open ports, network protocols, external interfaces, cloud services
- **Web Surface**: Endpoints, static assets, client-side vulnerabilities, third-party scripts
- **API Surface**: Authentication requirements, input validation, rate limiting, versioning
- **Data Surface**: Data stores, transmission methods, encryption status, backup locations
- **Infrastructure Surface**: Server configurations, cloud services, dependencies, supply chain

**Analysis Process**: Map all attack vectors, assess risk levels for each component, prioritize security controls based on risk assessment, and implement monitoring for high-risk surfaces.

## Security Controls Framework

### Preventive Controls
Controls that prevent security incidents from occurring:
- **Input Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs for injection attack prevention
- **Access Control**: Enforce role-based and resource-based permissions at every access point
- **Secure Configuration**: Validate encryption settings, password policies, network security configurations
- **Secure Development**: Code review processes, static analysis, dependency scanning, secure coding standards

### Detective Controls
Controls that detect security incidents as they occur:
- **Anomaly Detection**: Monitor user activity patterns for behavioral, location, and volume anomalies
- **System Integrity Monitoring**: Check file integrity, configuration changes, unauthorized access
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Centralized logging, correlation rules, threat intelligence
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular security assessments, penetration testing, dependency monitoring

### Responsive Controls
Controls that respond to and recover from security incidents:
- **Incident Response**: Threat containment, investigation procedures, remediation processes
- **Automated Response**: Account lockouts, IP blocking, service isolation, alert escalation
- **Business Continuity**: Backup procedures, disaster recovery, communication plans
- **Post-Incident**: Root cause analysis, security improvements, lessons learned documentation

## Authentication and Authorization
