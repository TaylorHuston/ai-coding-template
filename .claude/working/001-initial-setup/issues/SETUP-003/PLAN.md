# SETUP-003: Configure Testing Framework

## Goal

Establish a comprehensive testing framework supporting unit, integration, and end-to-end testing with coverage reporting to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Tasks

### Phase 1 - Setup & Foundation
- [ ] Review project technology stack
- [ ] Research testing framework options
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Plan testing strategy (TDD/BDD)

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation
- [ ] Install testing dependencies
  - [ ] Test runner (Jest/pytest)
  - [ ] Assertion libraries
  - [ ] Mocking libraries
  - [ ] Coverage tools
- [ ] Configure testing framework
  - [ ] Create configuration files
  - [ ] Set up test environments
  - [ ] Configure coverage thresholds
- [ ] Create test directory structure
  - [ ] Unit test directories
  - [ ] Integration test directories
  - [ ] E2E test directories
  - [ ] Test fixtures and helpers

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality
- [ ] Write sample tests for each type
- [ ] Verify coverage reporting works
- [ ] Test CI integration readiness
- [ ] Ensure tests run quickly

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Document testing patterns
- [ ] Create testing guidelines
- [ ] Add test commands to README
- [ ] Document coverage requirements

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment
- [ ] Self-review configuration
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Address feedback
- [ ] Merge to main branch

- [ ] Mock/stub capabilities configured
- [ ] Database test fixtures automated
- [ ] Test environment variables separated
- [ ] Sample tests created for each type
- [ ] Coverage reports generated correctly
- [ ] Tests run in under 5 minutes
- [ ] CI-ready test configuration

## Context

**Dependencies**: SETUP-001 (Repository), SETUP-002 (Development environment for test databases)
**Blocks**: SETUP-004 (Linting includes test files), SETUP-007 (CI/CD needs test configuration)
**Framework**: Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript, pytest for Python
