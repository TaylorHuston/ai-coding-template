# Quality Standards

**Purpose**: Comprehensive quality requirements and validation protocols for AI-assisted development projects

## Code Generation Standards

### **Pattern Compliance**
- Follow patterns established in the `examples/` directory
- Follow established language-specific patterns and conventions
- Use existing project patterns and conventions consistently
- Follow system guidelines in `CLAUDE.md` and quality standards in this document
- Never duplicate existing functionality without explicit justification

## Validation Protocol

### **Required Checks**
1. Validate all code against project technical standards
2. Follow security patterns from project security guidelines
3. Apply any legal/licensing requirements for AI-generated code
4. Document AI assistance level in all commit messages
5. Ensure comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
6. **Update CHANGELOG.md** for user-facing changes (features, fixes, breaking changes)

## Code Quality Gates

### **Mandatory Requirements**
- **Linting**: All code MUST pass existing linting and formatting standards
- **Security**: Security patterns MUST be followed for all implementations
- **Performance**: Performance considerations MUST be evaluated for user-facing changes
- **Documentation**: Documentation MUST be updated to reflect code changes
- **Testing**: Tests MUST be written or updated for all functional changes

## Architecture Compliance

### **Structural Requirements**
- Clear, consistent file organization patterns
- Well-documented code and project structure adherence
- Established conventions for reliable AI tool usage
- Context preservation strategies across development sessions
- Advanced memory management for long-term project continuity
- Structured approach to AI-human collaborative development

## Security and Legal Compliance

### **Security Standards**
- Follow all security guidelines in project security documentation
- Apply security patterns from established project rules
- Document the level of AI assistance in all generated code
- Ensure compliance with applicable legal frameworks
- Never compromise security for convenience or development speed

### **Legal Requirements**
- Document AI assistance in all generated code (where required)
- Follow attribution requirements for AI-generated content (where applicable)
- Comply with applicable legal frameworks and licensing
- Maintain audit trail for AI assistance usage (where required)

## Testing Standards

### **Coverage Requirements**
- **Unit Tests**: ≥80% coverage for new functionality
- **Integration Tests**: ≥70% coverage for API endpoints and critical paths
- **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user journeys must be covered
- **Error Handling**: All error paths must be tested

### **Test Quality**
- Tests must be deterministic and repeatable
- Test data must not contain sensitive information
- Tests must run in isolation without dependencies
- Test names must clearly describe what is being tested
- Tests should follow the testing patterns established in the project

## Performance Standards

### **Response Time Requirements**
- **API Endpoints**: <200ms for standard operations (adjust per project)
- **Page Load**: <3s on 3G networks (for web applications)
- **Database Queries**: <100ms for simple queries (adjust per project)
- **Build Time**: <30s for incremental builds (adjust per project)

### **Resource Limits**
- **Memory Usage**: Within project-defined limits
- **Bundle Size**: Follow project-specific size budgets
- **CPU Usage**: <30% average during normal operation (adjust per project)

## Documentation Standards

### **Required Documentation**
- **API Documentation**: All public interfaces must be documented
- **Code Comments**: Complex logic must have explanatory comments
- **README Updates**: Must reflect current functionality
- **Change Documentation**: All changes must be logged in CHANGELOG.md

### **Documentation Quality**
- Clear, concise language appropriate for target audience
- Include examples and usage patterns
- Maintain consistency with existing documentation style
- Follow project documentation guidelines and templates
- Keep documentation current with implementation changes

## Language-Agnostic Standards

### **Code Organization**
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout the project
- Organize code into logical modules or components
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Follow established project structure patterns

### **Error Handling**
- Implement comprehensive error handling for all failure modes
- Provide meaningful error messages to users and developers
- Log errors appropriately for debugging and monitoring
- Implement graceful degradation where possible

### **Configuration Management**
- Externalize configuration from code
- Use environment-appropriate configuration sources
- Implement configuration validation
- Document all configuration options and their effects

## Continuous Integration Requirements

### **Automated Checks**
- All code must pass automated testing suites
- Security scanning should be integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Code quality metrics should be tracked and maintained
- Documentation updates should be validated

### **Deployment Standards**
- Use consistent deployment processes across environments
- Implement proper rollback procedures
- Monitor deployments for errors and performance issues
- Maintain deployment logs and audit trails

## AI Assistance Standards

### **Documentation Requirements**
- Clearly mark AI-generated or AI-assisted code
- Document the level of AI assistance used
- Maintain consistency with human-written code quality
- Include human review validation in commit messages

### **Quality Assurance**
- AI-generated code must meet the same quality standards as human-written code
- Include additional review for complex AI-generated implementations
- Test AI-generated code thoroughly, especially edge cases
- Validate AI-generated documentation for accuracy and completeness

## Compliance and Monitoring

### **Quality Metrics**
- Track code quality metrics over time
- Monitor test coverage and maintain minimum thresholds
- Measure and optimize build and deployment times
- Track security vulnerability resolution times

### **Review Process**
- Implement code review requirements for all changes
- Include quality gate checks in review process
- Document and address quality standard violations
- Regular review and update of quality standards

## Framework-Specific Considerations

### **Web Applications**
- Implement responsive design principles
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals performance metrics
- Implement proper SEO practices

### **API Development**
- Follow RESTful design principles (or GraphQL best practices)
- Implement proper versioning strategies
- Include comprehensive input validation
- Provide clear error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

### **Database Applications**
- Implement proper indexing strategies
- Use appropriate transaction boundaries
- Follow database-specific best practices
- Implement proper data backup and recovery procedures

## Enforcement and Remediation

### **Quality Gate Enforcement**
- Block deployments that fail quality standards
- Implement automated quality checks in development workflow
- Provide clear feedback on quality standard violations
- Maintain exception process for urgent fixes

### **Continuous Improvement**
- Regular review of quality standards effectiveness
- Update standards based on project evolution and lessons learned
- Training and education on quality standards for team members
- Metrics-driven improvement of quality processes
