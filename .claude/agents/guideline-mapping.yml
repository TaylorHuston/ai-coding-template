# Agent-Specific Guideline Mapping
# Maps each agent to their relevant development guidelines for just-in-time loading
version: "0.2.0"
created: "2025-01-09"
last_updated: "2025-09-18"
purpose: "Define which guidelines each agent should load when starting work"

# Core principle: Only load guidelines relevant to the agent's domain
# This prevents context waste and information overload

# Universal guidelines that all agents should be aware of (loaded via CLAUDE.md):
# - Universal quality standards (patterns, conventions, changelog updates)
# - Critical rules (commit approval, test-first, branch-first)
# - Response protocol (concise, explicit, incremental, transparent)

# Optimization Summary (v0.2.0):
# - Consolidated 19 guideline files down to 12 files (37% reduction)
# - Extracted code examples to .resources/examples/ directory
# - Streamlined git-workflow.md from 913 to 308 lines (66% reduction)
# - All guideline files now under 400 lines for optimal AI processing
# - Maintained complete domain coverage with improved focus

# Usage pattern:
# 1. Agent starts work
# 2. Agent loads its mapped guidelines from docs/development/guidelines/
# 3. Agent applies domain-specific knowledge to task
# 4. Universal rules from CLAUDE.md always apply
