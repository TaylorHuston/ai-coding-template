# Implementation Plan: {task_id} {task_name}

{overview}

## Phases

### Phase 1 - {phase_1_name}
- [ ] 1.1 {step_description}
  - [ ] 1.1.1 {step_description}
- [ ] 1.2 {step_description}

### Phase 2 - {phase_2_name}
- [ ] 2.1 {step_description}
- [ ] 2.2 {step_description}

### Phase 3 - {phase_3_name}
- [ ] 3.1 {step_description}
- [ ] 3.2 {step_description}

**Note**: Phases are suggestions. Modify to fit your workflow!

**Alternative Patterns**:
- **Strict TDD**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle visible in every step
- **BDD Scenarios**: Define Given/When/Then → Implement tests → Build features
- **Test Pyramid**: Heavy unit, moderate integration, light E2E
- **Pragmatic**: Spike/explore → Write tests → Implement production code

## Complexity Analysis

**Score**: {complexity_score}/10

**Indicators**:
{complexity_indicators}

**Recommendation**: {decomposition_recommendation}
