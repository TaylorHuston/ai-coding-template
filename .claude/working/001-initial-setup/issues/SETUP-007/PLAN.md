# SETUP-007: CI/CD Pipeline

## Goal

Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, security scanning, and deployment across multiple environments to ensure code quality and reliable deployments.

## Tasks

### Phase 1 - Setup & Foundation
- [ ] Evaluate CI/CD platform options
- [ ] Design pipeline architecture
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Set up CI/CD accounts/access

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation
- [ ] Create CI pipeline
- [ ] Configure automated testing
- [ ] Set up build processes
- [ ] Implement security scanning
- [ ] Configure deployment workflows

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality
- [ ] Test pipeline execution
- [ ] Verify deployment processes
- [ ] Test rollback procedures
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Document pipeline processes
- [ ] Create deployment guides
- [ ] Add pipeline commands
- [ ] Train team on workflows

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment
- [ ] Review pipeline architecture
- [ ] Configure production deployment
- [ ] Set up monitoring integration
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI pipeline automated
