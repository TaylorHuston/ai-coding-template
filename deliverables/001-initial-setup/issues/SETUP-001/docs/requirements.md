# SETUP-001 Requirements

**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: P0 - Critical Foundation  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../../README.md)

## Overview

Initialize the project repository with proper version control, environment configuration, and a well-organized directory structure. This forms the foundation for all subsequent development work and ensures the project starts with professional standards.

## User Story

As a developer, I want a properly initialized repository with standard configurations so that I can start development with best practices from day one.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Git repository initialized with main branch as default
- [ ] Comprehensive .gitignore file covering all common patterns
- [ ] Environment variable system configured with .env.example template
- [ ] Standard directory structure created and documented
- [ ] Package manager initialized with lock file
- [ ] README.md created with project information
- [ ] LICENSE file added appropriate to project needs

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] No secrets or sensitive data in repository
- [ ] All paths use consistent naming conventions
- [ ] Configuration files follow project standards
- [ ] Directory structure supports scaling

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Verify .gitignore works correctly
- [ ] Test environment variable loading
- [ ] Confirm package manager commands work
- [ ] Validate directory structure created

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies

- Git installed and configured
- Node.js/Python/relevant runtime installed
- GitHub/GitLab account with repository access

### This Issue Blocks

- All other SETUP issues (002-009)
- Any development work

## Out of Scope

- CI/CD configuration (handled in SETUP-007)
- Development environment setup (handled in SETUP-002)
- Testing framework (handled in SETUP-003)

## Implementation Notes

- Use `.env.example` as template, never commit actual `.env` file
- Follow language-specific conventions for directory structure
- Consider mono-repo structure if multiple services planned
- Include common IDE and OS files in .gitignore

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Repository initialized and first commit made
- [ ] All files and directories created per requirements
- [ ] .gitignore tested and working
- [ ] Environment variables system functional
- [ ] Package manager configured and tested
- [ ] Documentation complete in README
- [ ] Team reviewed structure and approved
