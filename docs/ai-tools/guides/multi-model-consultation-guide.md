# Multi-Model Consultation Guide

**Transform critical AI decisions from single-perspective guesswork to validated, high-confidence architectural choices.**

This guide explains how to leverage the enhanced multi-model consultation capabilities in the AI coding template for better decision-making and higher-quality implementations.

## What Is Multi-Model Consultation?

Multi-model consultation combines Claude's project-aware expertise with Gemini's independent analysis to provide:

- **Cross-validation** of critical decisions
- **Alternative perspectives** on complex problems
- **Higher confidence** in architectural choices
- **Reduced blind spots** and biases
- **Comprehensive risk assessment**

## Enhanced Agents with Multi-Model Intelligence

### Tier 1: Critical Decision Agents (Automatic Consultation)

These 5 agents automatically invoke multi-model consultation for high-impact decisions:

#### 1. **code-architect** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Automatic Triggers:**
- Framework selection (React vs Vue vs Angular)
- Architecture paradigm (Microservices vs Monolith vs Serverless)
- Database choice (SQL vs NoSQL, PostgreSQL vs MongoDB)
- State management (Redux vs Zustand vs Context API)
- Authentication strategy (OAuth vs JWT vs Session-based)

**Usage Example:**
```bash
# During architectural exploration
/idea --start "Should we implement microservices architecture?"

# The code-architect agent will:
# 1. Analyze your current system with Claude's project knowledge
# 2. Cross-validate with Gemini's independent architectural analysis
# 3. Synthesize perspectives into comprehensive recommendation
# 4. Generate ADR with multi-model validation rationale
```

#### 2. **security-auditor** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Automatic Triggers:**
- Authentication/authorization design
- Data protection strategies
- Infrastructure security architecture
- Compliance implementation (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)

**Usage Example:**
```bash
# Security-critical decisions automatically get cross-validation
"Review the authentication system design"

# Results in:
# - Claude's security analysis with project context
# - Gemini's independent threat modeling
# - Combined security controls recommendation
# - Comprehensive compliance mapping
```

#### 3. **performance-optimizer** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Automatic Triggers:**
- Bottleneck analysis approaches
- Caching strategy selection
- Database optimization methods
- Scaling architecture decisions

#### 4. **api-designer** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Automatic Triggers:**
- API paradigm selection (REST vs GraphQL)
- Endpoint design patterns
- Data validation strategies
- Error handling approaches

#### 5. **database-specialist** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Automatic Triggers:**
- Schema design decisions
- Query optimization strategies
- Database scaling approaches
- Migration planning

## How Multi-Model Consultation Works

### The 4-Step Process

#### 1. **Primary Analysis (Claude)**
- Analyzes requirements with full project context
- Evaluates options based on existing codebase patterns
- Considers team expertise and constraints
- Generates initial recommendation

#### 2. **Independent Validation (Gemini)**
- Receives decision context without Claude's conclusion
- Provides independent analysis of options
- Offers alternative implementation strategies
- Assesses different risks and trade-offs

#### 3. **Consensus Building**
The system evaluates agreement levels and determines confidence:

```yaml
consensus_levels:
  high_agreement:
    confidence: "95%"
    action: "Proceed with confidence - both models align"

  moderate_agreement:
    confidence: "85%"
    action: "Proceed with noted differences"

  low_agreement:
    confidence: "60%"
    action: "Deep dive analysis required"

  conflicting_recommendations:
    confidence: "40%"
    action: "Present trade-off analysis to user"
```

#### 4. **Decision Documentation**
Every multi-model consultation generates comprehensive documentation:
- **Context**: Problem space and requirements
- **Claude's Analysis**: Primary recommendation with reasoning
- **Gemini's Analysis**: Alternative perspective and considerations
- **Consensus**: Areas of agreement and divergence
- **Final Decision**: Chosen approach with validation rationale
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identified risks and mitigation strategies

## Manual Consultation Patterns

### Explicit Second Opinions
Request multi-model consultation anytime with these phrases:
```bash
"Get a second opinion on this architecture"
"Cross-validate this design decision with Gemini"
"I need multiple perspectives on this approach"
"Validate our security strategy with another analysis"
```

### During Workflow Phases

#### In `/idea` (Architectural Exploration)
```bash
/idea --start "How should we handle real-time notifications?"
# During conversation: "Let me get Gemini's perspective on this WebSocket vs SSE decision"
```

#### In `/plan` (Implementation Planning)
```bash
/plan --issue NOTIFY-123
# Agent automatically consults Gemini for critical architectural decisions
```

#### In `/iterate` (Task Execution)
```bash
/iterate P1.2.0
# Agents invoke multi-model consultation for implementation approach validation
```

## Best Practices for Multi-Model Decisions

### When to Trust High Consensus (95%+)
‚úÖ Both models agree on approach and implementation
‚úÖ Risk assessment aligns between perspectives
‚úÖ Trade-offs are consistently identified
‚úÖ **Action**: Proceed with confidence

### When to Investigate Moderate Consensus (85-94%)
‚ö†Ô∏è Models agree on direction but differ on implementation details
‚ö†Ô∏è Similar risk assessment with different mitigation strategies
‚ö†Ô∏è **Action**: Document both perspectives and choose based on project context

### When to Deep Dive Low Consensus (60-84%)
üîç Significant differences in approach or risk assessment
üîç Different underlying assumptions about requirements
üîç **Action**: Gather more context, clarify requirements, potentially consult domain experts

### When to Escalate Conflicts (<60%)
üö® Fundamentally different recommendations
üö® Conflicting risk assessments
üö® **Action**: Human architectural review required with comprehensive pros/cons analysis

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Database Selection
**Scenario**: E-commerce platform needs to choose between PostgreSQL and MongoDB

**Claude's Analysis**:
- Recommends PostgreSQL for ACID compliance
- Considers existing team SQL expertise
- Values transactional consistency for financial data

**Gemini's Analysis**:
- Suggests MongoDB for product catalog flexibility
- Highlights horizontal scaling benefits
- Recommends hybrid approach with both databases

**Synthesis** (Moderate Agreement - 85%):
- Use PostgreSQL for transactional data (orders, payments)
- Use MongoDB for product catalog and user preferences
- Implement data synchronization patterns
- **Decision**: Hybrid approach with clear data boundaries

### Example 2: Security Architecture
**Scenario**: Authentication system design for SaaS application

**Claude's Analysis**:
- OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
- Redis for session management
- Multi-factor authentication required

**Gemini's Analysis**:
- OAuth 2.0 with opaque tokens
- Database session storage for audit trails
- Biometric authentication consideration

**Synthesis** (High Agreement - 95%):
- OAuth 2.0 consensus (implementation differs)
- Both emphasize MFA importance
- Audit trail requirements align
- **Decision**: OAuth 2.0 with opaque tokens and database sessions for compliance

## Quality Metrics and Success Measurement

### Decision Confidence Metrics
```yaml
success_targets:
  decision_confidence: "90% confidence in critical architectural decisions"
  mistake_prevention: "80% reduction in architectural rework"
  comprehensive_analysis: "100% coverage of alternative approaches considered"

measurement_approaches:
  post_implementation_validation: "Survey confidence levels after delivery"
  rework_tracking: "Monitor architectural changes after initial decision"
  perspective_coverage: "ADR completeness and diversity analysis"
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Consultation Response Time**: Target <30 seconds for most decisions
- **Cost Impact**: ~2x model usage for critical decisions (typically <5% of total decisions)
- **User Satisfaction**: Target >85% satisfaction with decision quality

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### MCP Server Not Available
If `mcp__gemini-cli__prompt` is not available:
1. Ensure Gemini CLI is installed (see Prerequisites in README)
2. Check MCP server configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json`
3. Verify `gemini-cli` is in `enabledMcpjsonServers` array
4. Fallback to direct CLI: `gemini "your consultation request"`

### Consensus Calculation Unclear
If consensus levels seem inaccurate:
1. Check that both models received equivalent context
2. Verify decision criteria are clearly specified
3. Consider if models are interpreting requirements differently
4. Manual review may be needed for complex decisions

### Performance Issues
If consultations are too slow:
1. Use consultation selectively for truly critical decisions
2. Consider async consultation for non-blocking decisions
3. Implement caching for similar decision contexts
4. Use lighter models for less critical validations

## Advanced Usage Patterns

### Custom Consultation Workflows
Create specialized multi-model workflows for your domain:

```python
# Example: Custom security validation
def security_consultation(threat_model, architecture):
    claude_analysis = security_auditor.analyze(threat_model, architecture)
    gemini_analysis = gemini_cli_prompt(
        f"Independent security analysis: {threat_model}\n"
        f"Architecture: {architecture}\n"
        f"Focus on attack vectors and defensive measures."
    )
    return synthesize_security_perspectives(claude_analysis, gemini_analysis)
```

### Integration with Existing Tools
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automatic consultation for deployment architecture changes
- **Code Review**: Multi-model validation during high-risk code reviews
- **Architecture Reviews**: Structured multi-model evaluation sessions
