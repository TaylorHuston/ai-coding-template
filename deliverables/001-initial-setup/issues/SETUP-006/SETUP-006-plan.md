# Issue Plan - SETUP-006

**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Type**: Setup/Configuration  
**Status**: Planning  
**External Ticket**: N/A  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../README.md)  

## Issue Summary

Establish comprehensive security scanning and dependency management including SBOM generation, vulnerability scanning, and supply chain security measures following 2025 best practices.

## User Story

As a security-conscious developer, I want automated security scanning and dependency management so that I can identify and fix vulnerabilities before they reach production.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 - Setup & Foundation

- [ ] Assess security requirements
- [ ] Research SBOM standards (SPDX/CycloneDX)
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Document security policies

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation

- [ ] Set up SBOM generation
  - [ ] Configure CycloneDX/SPDX
  - [ ] Automate generation in CI
  - [ ] Include in releases
- [ ] Configure vulnerability scanning
  - [ ] Set up Snyk/Dependabot
  - [ ] Configure audit tools
  - [ ] Set severity thresholds
- [ ] Implement secrets scanning
  - [ ] Configure git-secrets/gitleaks
  - [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks
  - [ ] Configure CI scanning

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality

- [ ] Test SBOM generation
- [ ] Verify vulnerability detection
- [ ] Test secrets scanning
- [ ] Fix identified issues

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish

- [ ] Create security policy
- [ ] Document scanning procedures
- [ ] Create vulnerability response plan
- [ ] Document SBOM usage

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment

- [ ] Security review of setup
- [ ] Fix all high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Configure automated updates
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Technical Approach

Implement defense-in-depth with multiple scanning layers: dependency vulnerabilities, secrets detection, SAST scanning, and comprehensive SBOM for supply chain transparency.

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **Blocking**: SETUP-001 (Repository setup)
- **Requires**: Package manager configuration

### Risks
- False positives causing fatigue: Configure appropriate thresholds
- Breaking changes from updates: Test updates in CI first

## Changelog Entry

**Type**: Added  
**Description**: Security scanning with SBOM generation and vulnerability management  
**Breaking Change**: No  

## Definition of Done

- [ ] SBOM generation automated
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning active
- [ ] Secrets scanning configured
- [ ] No high/critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Security policy documented
- [ ] Automated updates configured
