# Issue Plan - SETUP-003

**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Type**: Setup/Configuration  
**Status**: Planning  
**External Ticket**: N/A  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../README.md)  

## Issue Summary

Establish a comprehensive testing framework supporting unit, integration, and end-to-end testing with coverage reporting. This ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and enables confident refactoring throughout the project lifecycle.

## User Story

As a developer, I want a complete testing framework so that I can write and run tests efficiently and maintain high code quality.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 - Setup & Foundation

- [ ] Review project technology stack
- [ ] Research testing framework options
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Plan testing strategy (TDD/BDD)

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation

- [ ] Install testing dependencies
  - [ ] Test runner (Jest/pytest)
  - [ ] Assertion libraries
  - [ ] Mocking libraries
  - [ ] Coverage tools
- [ ] Configure testing framework
  - [ ] Create configuration files
  - [ ] Set up test environments
  - [ ] Configure coverage thresholds
- [ ] Create test directory structure
  - [ ] Unit test directories
  - [ ] Integration test directories
  - [ ] E2E test directories
  - [ ] Test fixtures and helpers

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality

- [ ] Write sample tests for each type
- [ ] Verify coverage reporting works
- [ ] Test CI integration readiness
- [ ] Ensure tests run quickly

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish

- [ ] Document testing patterns
- [ ] Create testing guidelines
- [ ] Add test commands to README
- [ ] Document coverage requirements

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment

- [ ] Self-review configuration
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Address feedback
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Technical Approach

Implement Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript projects (or pytest for Python) with separate configurations for unit, integration, and E2E tests. Use coverage tools to enforce minimum 80% code coverage.

## Dependencies & Risks

### Dependencies
- **Blocking**: SETUP-001 (Repository initialization)
- **Requires**: Package manager configured

### Risks
- Test execution time: Mitigate with parallel execution
- Flaky tests: Implement retry mechanisms

## Changelog Entry

**Type**: Added  
**Description**: Comprehensive testing framework with Jest/pytest and coverage reporting  
**Breaking Change**: No  

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Testing framework installed and configured
- [ ] All test types supported (unit/integration/e2e)
- [ ] Coverage reporting functional
- [ ] Sample tests created and passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Team reviewed and approved
