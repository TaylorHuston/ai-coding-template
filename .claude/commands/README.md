# Claude Code Command Reference

**Created**: 2025-08-21 **Last Updated**: 2025-09-18 **Status**: Active - Claude Code Compatible **Target Audience**: AI Assistants, Development Team

Streamlined catalog of Claude Code slash commands centered around the **4-phase epic-driven workflow** that transforms AI from code generator to architectural partner.

## üåü Core Workflow Commands (Primary)

**THE 4-PHASE EPIC WORKFLOW: From vision to validated execution**

### üìù **/design** - Vision, Epics, and Requirements

- _Purpose_: Create and document non-technical project aspects from vision to epic structure
- _Usage_: `/design --vision | --epic "name" | --task "name" | --review`
- _Workflow Phase_: **1. Design** - Vision documents, epic structure, user stories, business context

### üèóÔ∏è **/architect** - Technical Architecture and Infrastructure

- _Purpose_: Design technical solutions through Quick Mode (5-10 min) or Deep Mode (20+ min) exploration
- _Usage_: `/architect epic-name | --deep | "direct question"`
- _Workflow Phase_: **2. Architecture** - Technical decisions, ADRs, Fast Track vs comprehensive analysis

### üìã **/plan** - Epic-Driven Implementation Planning

- _Purpose_: Create epic structure with progressive task discovery and X.Y.Z implementation tasks
- _Usage_: `/plan --epic "name" --issue KEY | --review | --init`
- _Workflow Phase_: **3. Planning** - Epic directories, TASK-### numbering, agent assignment, testing integration

### ‚ö° **/develop** - Streamlined Development Execution

- _Purpose_: Execute implementation tasks with test-first enforcement and epic integration
- _Usage_: `/develop | /develop --task TASK-### | --epic "name"`
- _Workflow Phase_: **4. Execution** - Test-first development, 95%+ coverage, hierarchical branching

## üöÄ Epic Workflow Usage Patterns

### The Complete Epic Workflow (Recommended for All Features)

```yaml
# Complete Epic Development Workflow
core_workflow: "/design ‚Üí /architect ‚Üí /plan ‚Üí /develop"

# Epic Structure Creation
epic_creation:
  phase_1_design:
    command: "design --epic 'epic-name'"
    purpose: "Non-technical foundation"
    output: "Vision documents, user stories, business context"

  phase_2_architecture:
    command: "architect epic-name"
    purpose: "Technical decisions"
    output: "ADRs with Quick Mode (5-10 min) or Deep Mode (20+ min)"
    modes:
      quick_mode: "Standard decisions (90% of cases)"
      deep_mode: "Complex analysis (10% of cases)"
      direct_questions: "architect 'NextJS or React?'"

  phase_3_planning:
    command: "plan --epic 'epic-name' --issue KEY"
    purpose: "Implementation structure"
    output: "Epic directory with TASK-### progressive discovery"
    structure:
      - "epics/epic-name/EPIC.md"
      - "epics/epic-name/TASK-001/ (with TASK.md, HANDOFF.yml, RESEARCH.md)"
      - "epics/epic-name/resources/ (ADRs, research, assets)"

  phase_4_execution:
    command: "develop"
    purpose: "Test-first implementation"
    output: "Quality-validated code with 95%+ coverage"
    features:
      - "Auto-invoked test-engineer"
      - "X.Y.Z implementation tasks"
      - "Hierarchical epic/task branching"

# Progressive Task Discovery
task_numbering:
  format: "TASK-###"
  discovery_order: "Numbered across ALL workflow phases"
  implementation: "X.Y.Z hierarchical subtasks (e.g., TASK-001:1.2.3)"

# Branching Strategy
epic_branching:
  structure: "epic/[name] containing task/###-[name]"
  workflow: "Task ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Develop merging"
  local_focus: "No PRs initially, local merging workflow"
```

### Quality-First Development Pattern

```yaml
pattern: "design ‚Üí architect ‚Üí plan ‚Üí develop ‚Üí quality ‚Üí commit"
use_case: "Security-critical or high-visibility features"
additional_validation: [quality, review, security-audit]
coverage_requirement: "95%+ with TDD/BDD hybrid approach"
```

### Quick Decision Pattern

```yaml
pattern: "architect 'direct question' ‚Üí quick implementation"
use_case: "Simple architectural decisions"
example: "architect 'Should we use JWT or sessions?'"
time_investment: "5-10 minutes for standard decisions"
```
