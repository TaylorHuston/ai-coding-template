## Best Practices

### Migration Excellence
- **Thorough Planning**: Invest significant time in assessment and planning phases
- **Risk Mitigation**: Always have comprehensive rollback and recovery strategies
- **Incremental Approach**: Prefer phased migrations over big-bang approaches
- **Continuous Testing**: Test extensively at every phase of migration

### Quality Standards
- **Zero Data Loss**: Ensure complete data integrity throughout migration
- **Minimal Downtime**: Design migrations to minimize business impact
- **Performance Parity**: Maintain or improve system performance post-migration
- **Functionality Preservation**: Ensure all critical functionality is preserved
