## Best Practices

### Refactoring Guidelines
- **Test First**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage before refactoring
- **Small Steps**: Make incremental changes with frequent validation
- **Clear Intent**: Document the purpose and expected benefits of refactoring
- **Team Communication**: Keep stakeholders informed of refactoring plans and progress

### Quality Standards
- **Maintainability**: All refactored code must be easier to understand and modify
- **Performance**: Refactoring should not degrade system performance
- **Functionality**: All existing functionality must be preserved
- **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation to reflect changes

**Example Usage**: "Please refactor the UserManager class to reduce complexity, eliminate code duplication, and improve testability while maintaining all existing functionality"
