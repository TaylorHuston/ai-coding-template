# Vision Document: Multi-User Todo Application

_Note that this is an example vision for the test app in the src directory_

## 1. The Problem

The AI Coding Template needs a realistic test application to validate all workflows, scripts, hooks, and agent coordination patterns. Currently, the template has comprehensive documentation and sophisticated AI agents, but lacks a complete reference implementation that demonstrates the full development lifecycle from vision through deployment. Without this validation vehicle, we cannot ensure that all template components work seamlessly together or provide developers with a concrete example of the AI-assisted development workflow in action.

---

## 2. The Solution

Build a multi-user todo list application with local storage that serves as both a template validation vehicle and reference implementation. This application will exercise the complete `/vision` → `/feature` → `/architect` → `/plan` → `/develop` workflow while demonstrating real-world development patterns including user management, data persistence, and modern frontend architecture. The todo app domain is familiar enough for immediate comprehension while providing sufficient complexity to require meaningful architectural decisions and agent coordination.

## 3. Target Audience

- **Primary User:** AI Coding Template development team
- **Characteristics:**

  - Testing and validating template workflows and tooling
  - Identifying gaps or issues in agent coordination
  - Validating quality gates and automation scripts
  - Creating reference patterns for future template users

- **Secondary User:** Developers evaluating or learning the template
- **Characteristics:**
  - Want to see complete workflow examples
  - Need reference implementation for common patterns
  - Evaluating AI-assisted development effectiveness
  - Learning template agent coordination patterns

---

## 4. Core Features (Version 1.0)

### User Management

- **User Registration/Login:** Simple form-based authentication with local storage
- **User Switching:** Dropdown or profile switcher for multiple local accounts
- **Basic User Profiles:** Name, preferences, and basic customization options

### Todo Management

- **CRUD Operations:** Create, edit, delete, and update todos
- **Status Management:** Mark todos as complete/incomplete with visual indicators
- **Organization:** Todo categories/tags and priority levels
- **Scheduling:** Due dates and basic reminder functionality

### Data Persistence

- **Local Storage:** Browser localStorage or IndexedDB for data persistence
- **Data Isolation:** Separate todo lists per user account
- **Import/Export:** Basic data backup and restore capabilities

### Template Validation Features

- **Component Patterns:** Demonstrate modern React/Vue/Angular patterns
- **State Management:** Show proper state management architecture
- **Form Handling:** Validate form patterns and user input handling
- **Error Handling:** Demonstrate proper error states and recovery

---

## 5. Key Differentiators

- **Template-First Design:** Every architectural decision made through AI agent consultation and documented through ADRs
- **Complete Workflow Example:** Demonstrates the full AI-assisted development lifecycle from vision to deployment
- **Quality Reference:** Showcases proper testing, documentation, and code quality patterns established by the template
- **Agent Coordination Showcase:** Demonstrates how 19+ specialized AI agents work together on a real project

---

## 6. Success Metrics

### Primary Success Metrics (Template Validation)

- **Workflow Completion:** Successfully complete all 5 phases (vision → feature → architect → plan → develop)
- **Agent Utilization:** Exercise at least 12 of the 19 specialized agents meaningfully
- **Quality Gates:** Pass all automated quality checks (linting, tests, security audits)
- **Documentation:** Generate complete technical documentation through automated processes

### Template Validation Metrics

- **Command Effectiveness:** All slash commands produce expected outputs and handoffs
- **Agent Coordination:** Smooth context preservation between agent transitions
- **Quality Automation:** All scripts, hooks, and validation tools function correctly
- **Code Standards:** Meets all established coding standards and architectural principles

### Reference Implementation Metrics

- **Code Quality Score:** Achieve >9.0/10 on automated quality assessment
- **Documentation Coverage:** 100% coverage of architectural decisions and patterns
- **Test Coverage:** >90% test coverage with comprehensive test patterns
- **Security Compliance:** Pass all security audits and vulnerability scans

---

## 7. Strategic Context

### Template Integration Purpose

This application serves as the primary validation vehicle for the AI Coding Template, ensuring all components work together seamlessly while creating a reference implementation for future users.

### Technical Validation Goals

- Validate agent specialization and coordination patterns
- Test quality gates and automation workflows
- Demonstrate modern development patterns and best practices
- Showcase AI-assisted decision making and documentation

### Business Context

This is an internal validation project with the secondary benefit of creating valuable reference material for template adoption and evaluation.

## 8. Vision Evolution

### Version History

| Version | Date       | Changes        | Rationale                   |
| ------- | ---------- | -------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1.0.0   | 2025-09-17 | Initial vision | Template validation kickoff |

### Validation Results

_To be updated as we gather evidence through the development process_

### Next Review Date

**Scheduled:** After completion of `/develop` phase - Full validation review and lessons learned

## Vision Validation Framework

### Feature Alignment Scoring

Use this framework to evaluate implementation decisions:

- **Template Validation (1-10):** How well does this demonstrate template capabilities?
- **Agent Exercise (1-10):** How many agents does this meaningfully engage?
- **Quality Showcase (1-10):** How well does this demonstrate quality patterns?
- **Reference Value (1-10):** How useful is this as a reference implementation?

**Minimum threshold for feature consideration: 32/40 total score**

### Architecture Validation

- Does technical architecture demonstrate template's architectural guidance capabilities?
- Do agent decisions result in well-documented, maintainable code?
- Are all quality gates and automation tools properly exercised?
- Does the implementation showcase modern development patterns?

### Planning Validation

- Are template-critical validation items prioritized in development plan?
- Does task breakdown demonstrate proper agent specialization?
- Are all workflow phases properly represented in the implementation plan?
- Do success metrics align with template validation goals?

## Confidence Indicators

### High Confidence (90-100%)

- **Problem Definition:** Template needs validation vehicle
- **Solution Approach:** Todo app provides right complexity level
- **Target Audience:** Template team and future developers
- **Core Feature Set:** User management + todo CRUD + local storage

### Medium Confidence (70-89%)

- **Technical Stack:** Will be determined through `/architect` phase
- **Agent Utilization:** Specific agent coordination patterns
- **Timeline:** Development duration and milestone planning

### Low Confidence (50-69%)

- **Advanced Features:** Real-time updates, data sync capabilities
- **Performance Requirements:** Specific performance benchmarks
- **Deployment Strategy:** Production deployment considerations

### Outstanding Questions

- [ ] Which frontend framework will best demonstrate template capabilities?
- [ ] Should we include real-time features to test WebSocket patterns?
- [ ] What level of UI/UX polish is needed for reference quality?
- [ ] Should this include deployment automation examples?

### Assumptions to Validate

- [ ] Todo app domain is sufficient for exercising all agent types
- [ ] Local storage approach adequately tests data architecture decisions
- [ ] Template workflow will produce high-quality, maintainable code
- [ ] Agent coordination will result in coherent architectural decisions
