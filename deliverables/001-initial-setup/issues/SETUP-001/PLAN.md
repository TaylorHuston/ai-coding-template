# SETUP-001: Initialize Repository & Core Structure

## Goal
Initialize the project repository with proper version control, environment configuration, and a well-organized directory structure to form the foundation for development.

## Tasks
- [ ] Initialize Git repository with main branch
- [ ] Create comprehensive .gitignore file
- [ ] Set up environment variables (.env.example)
- [ ] Create project directory structure
- [ ] Initialize package manager with lock file
- [ ] Create README.md with project info
- [ ] Add LICENSE file if applicable
- [ ] Configure security (no secrets in repo)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Git repository functional with main branch
- [ ] .gitignore covers all common patterns
- [ ] Environment variables system working
- [ ] Directory structure follows best practices
- [ ] Package manager commands functional

## Context
Foundation issue that blocks all other setup work. Follow language-specific conventions for directory structure. Consider mono-repo structure if multiple services planned.
