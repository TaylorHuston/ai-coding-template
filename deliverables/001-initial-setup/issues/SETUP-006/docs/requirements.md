**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: P0 - Critical  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../../README.md)

## Overview

Implement comprehensive security scanning and dependency management including SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation, vulnerability scanning, and supply chain security measures to protect against security threats.

## User Story

As a security-conscious team, we want automated security scanning and dependency management so that we can prevent vulnerabilities from entering our codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] SBOM generated in standard format (SPDX/CycloneDX)
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scanning functional
- [ ] Secrets scanning preventing commits
- [ ] Security linting (SAST) configured
- [ ] Dependency update automation set up
- [ ] License compliance verified
- [ ] Security policy documented

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] No high or critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] SBOM includes all dependencies
- [ ] Scanning integrated in CI/CD
- [ ] Update notifications configured
- [ ] False positive management system

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Vulnerability detection tested
- [ ] Secrets scanning verified
- [ ] SBOM generation validated
- [ ] Update process tested

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies

- SETUP-001 (Repository and package setup)
- SETUP-004 (Linting infrastructure)

### This Issue Blocks

- SETUP-007 (CI/CD needs security scanning)
- Production deployment (security requirements)

## Out of Scope

- Runtime security monitoring
- Penetration testing setup
- WAF configuration
- Infrastructure security

## Implementation Notes

- Follow NIST/CISA guidelines for SBOM
- Use multiple scanning tools for coverage
- Implement gradual rollout for updates
- Document security exceptions clearly

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All security tools configured
- [ ] No unaddressed vulnerabilities
- [ ] SBOM generation automated
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Security policy approved
- [ ] Team trained on procedures
