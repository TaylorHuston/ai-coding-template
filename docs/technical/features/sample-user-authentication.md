# Feature: User Authentication

**Purpose:** Enable secure user access to the application with JWT-based authentication
**User Benefit:** Users can securely register, log in, and access personalized features
**Success Criteria:**
- Users can register with email/password
- Users can log in securely with session persistence
- Password reset functionality works reliably
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks

**External Reference:** SAMPLE-AUTH-001 (example)

## Problem Statement

Users need a secure way to access the application and maintain sessions across devices. Currently there is no authentication system, which prevents personalization and secure access to user-specific features.

## Functional Requirements

- Email/password registration and login
- JWT-based session management with 30-day persistence
- Password reset via email verification
- Rate limiting on authentication attempts (5 attempts per 10 minutes)
- Secure password storage with bcrypt hashing
- User profile management (basic)

## User Experience

- Primary user flow: Register → Email verification → Login → Dashboard
- Key interactions: Login form, registration form, password reset form
- Error handling: Clear error messages for invalid credentials, rate limiting, server errors

## Technical Approach

- Architecture pattern: REST API with JWT tokens
- Key technologies: Node.js/Express, bcrypt, Redis for sessions, email service
- Integration points: Email service for verification/reset, Redis for session storage

## Dependencies

- Internal: Email service configuration, database schema
- External: Redis instance, SMTP service (SendGrid/Mailgun)
- Infrastructure: SSL certificates for secure authentication

## Success Metrics

- Performance: < 200ms login response time, < 500ms registration
- Usage: 90% successful login rate, < 5% password reset requests
- Quality: Zero authentication bypass vulnerabilities, 99.9% uptime

## Implementation Notes

- Known constraints: GDPR compliance for user data, password complexity requirements
- Security considerations: JWT secret rotation, secure cookie settings, HTTPS only
- Performance considerations: Database query optimization, Redis session cleanup
