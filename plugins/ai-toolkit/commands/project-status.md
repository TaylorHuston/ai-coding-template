# /project-status Command

Enhanced project status dashboard with intelligent analysis using context-analyzer agent.

**Note**: Renamed from `/status` to avoid conflict with built-in Claude Code `/status` command.

## Usage

```bash
# Basic intelligent status report
/project-status

# AI-optimized format for assistants
/project-status --ai-format

# Enhanced with memory insights and personalization
/project-status --with-memory

# Detailed analysis with recommendations
/project-status --detailed

# Specific scope analysis
/project-status --scope git
/project-status --scope project
/project-status --scope environment

# JSON output for programmatic use
/project-status --format json
```

## Agent Coordination

**Primary**: context-analyzer (intelligent analysis and pattern recognition beyond basic status)
**Supporting**: data-analyst (metrics and trend analysis), technical-writer (status report formatting)
**Integration**: Provides comprehensive project status through intelligent agent analysis

## Features

### Intelligent Context Analysis

Uses **context-analyzer** agent to provide deep insights beyond basic status:

- **Git Repository Analysis**: Branch strategy assessment, commit patterns, merge conflicts
- **Project Health Assessment**: Code quality trends, technical debt indicators
- **Workflow State Analysis**: Current workflow phase, task progress, blockers
- **Development Patterns**: Team productivity metrics, code review patterns
- **Environment Consistency**: Development environment validation, dependency issues

### Enhanced Status Dimensions

```yaml
status_dimensions:
  git_intelligence:
    basic: [branch, commits, status]
    enhanced: [branch_strategy_analysis, commit_pattern_insights, merge_conflict_prediction]
    agent: context-analyzer

  project_health:
    basic: [file_counts, directory_structure]
    enhanced: [code_quality_trends, technical_debt_assessment, architecture_health]
    agent: context-analyzer

  workflow_state:
    basic: [current_files, recent_changes]
    enhanced: [workflow_phase_analysis, task_progress_insights, blocker_identification]
    agent: context-analyzer

  environment_analysis:
    basic: [tools, dependencies]
    enhanced: [environment_consistency, dependency_vulnerability_assessment, toolchain_optimization]
    agent: context-analyzer

  development_insights:
    basic: [recent_activity]
    enhanced: [productivity_patterns, collaboration_insights, quality_trends]
    agent: context-analyzer
```

## AI-Driven Status Analysis

Pure AI agent coordination for comprehensive project status:

```yaml
agent_analysis:
  data_collection:
    approach: AI-driven repository analysis
    purpose: "Gather comprehensive project status through intelligent inspection"

  pattern_recognition:
