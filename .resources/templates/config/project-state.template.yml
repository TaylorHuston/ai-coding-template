# Project State Configuration for AI Tool Selection
# Generated by /init command - guides tool selection based on project maturity

project_maturity: fresh_template  # fresh_template | developing | established
preferred_tools:
  file_discovery: glob      # glob | serena
  code_analysis: grep       # grep | serena
  template_search: glob     # always glob for templates

# Assessment metadata
last_assessed: "2025-09-19"
assessment_criteria:
  implementation_files: 0   # Number of files in src/
  epic_tasks: 0            # Number of real tasks in epics/
  git_commits: 1           # User commits beyond template
  serena_ready: false      # Whether project benefits from Serena

# Tool selection reasoning
reasoning: "Fresh template installation - minimal project code, Serena provides limited value per documentation"

# Transition thresholds for tool upgrades
transition_thresholds:
  developing: "5+ implementation files OR 1+ epic with tasks"
  established: "20+ implementation files OR complex code structure"
  serena_beneficial: "Complex codebase with semantic analysis needs"

# Usage guidance for AI assistants
usage_notes:
  - "Check this file before using Serena tools"
  - "Use Glob for file discovery in fresh/developing projects"
  - "Transition to Serena when project complexity justifies it"
  - "Re-run /init --force to reassess after significant development"
