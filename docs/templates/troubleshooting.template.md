   - Look for: Permission denied errors

### Step 3: Fix Implementation

Choose the appropriate fix based on your diagnosis:

#### Fix A: Configuration Issue
```bash
# Commands to fix configuration
echo "Applying configuration fix..."
# Add specific commands
```

#### Fix B: Dependency Issue
```bash
# Commands to fix dependencies
echo "Resolving dependency issues..."
# Add specific commands
```

#### Fix C: Permission Issue
```bash
# Commands to fix permissions
echo "Updating permissions..."
# Add specific commands
```

### Step 4: Verification

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```bash
# Enable debug mode
export DEBUG=true
export LOG_LEVEL=debug

# Run the problematic operation
# Add specific debug commands
```

### Log Analysis

Key log locations:
- Application logs: `/path/to/app.log`
- System logs: `/path/to/system.log`
- Error logs: `/path/to/error.log`

Search for these patterns:
```bash
# Common error patterns
grep -i "error\|exception\|failed" /path/to/logs/
grep -i "{{ISSUE_TITLE}}" /path/to/logs/
```

### System Information

Collect system information for further analysis:

```bash
# System info collection script
echo "=== System Information ==="
uname -a
echo "=== Memory Usage ==="
free -h
echo "=== Disk Usage ==="
df -h
echo "=== Process Information ==="
ps aux | grep {{PROCESS_NAME}}
```

## Prevention

### Monitoring Setup

Set up monitoring to catch this issue early:

```bash
# Monitoring commands or configuration
# Add specific monitoring setup
```

### Health Checks

Regular health checks to prevent the issue:

```bash
# Health check script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running health checks..."
# Add health check commands
```

Schedule this script to run:
```bash
# Add to crontab
0 */6 * * * /path/to/health-check.sh
```
