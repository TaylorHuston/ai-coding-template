**Target Audience**: Developers, Architects, AI Assistants

## Purpose & Introduction

This directory serves as the comprehensive architectural documentation hub for AI-assisted development. Every major feature area, system component, and architectural decision should be documented here to enable both AI agents and human developers to quickly understand and contribute to the codebase.

### Why Architectural Documentation Matters in AI-Assisted Development

1. **AI Context Enhancement**: Well-structured architecture docs provide AI assistants with the context needed to make informed decisions about code changes, feature implementations, and system integrations.

2. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Clear documentation serves as a shared knowledge base, ensuring both humans and AI agents work from the same understanding of system design and constraints.

3. **Code Quality Consistency**: Documented architectural patterns help maintain consistency across implementations, whether generated by AI or written by humans.

4. **Faster Onboarding**: New team members and AI agents can quickly understand system structure, design decisions, and implementation patterns.

5. **Decision Preservation**: Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) capture the reasoning behind design choices, preventing repeated debates and maintaining context over time.

### How AI Agents Should Use These Documents

**For Feature Implementation**:

- Read relevant architecture documents before implementing new features
- Follow established patterns and conventions documented here
- Reference data models, API contracts, and integration points
- Validate implementations against documented requirements and constraints

**For Code Analysis**:

- Use architecture docs to understand system boundaries and responsibilities
- Reference component relationships when analyzing dependencies
- Check security and performance requirements before making optimizations
- Validate proposed changes against documented architectural principles

**For Documentation Updates**:

- Update architecture docs when implementing new features or making changes
- Follow the documentation standards and templates provided
- Maintain consistency with existing documentation patterns
- Reference related documents appropriately

### Integration with Main Architecture Guide

This directory works in conjunction with the main [Architecture Guide](../architecture.md), which provides:

- High-level system design principles
- AI-friendly coding patterns
- Cross-cutting concerns and standards
- General architectural best practices

The feature-specific documents in this directory provide detailed implementation guidance for individual system components.

## Documentation Organization

### Recommended Structure for Feature-Specific Architecture Files

Each feature area should have its own architecture document following this structure:

```text
docs/architecture/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                           # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ authentication-architecture.md      # User auth & authorization systems
â”œâ”€â”€ data-layer-architecture.md         # Database design & data flow
â”œâ”€â”€ api-design-architecture.md         # REST/GraphQL API patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ frontend-architecture.md           # UI components & state management
â”œâ”€â”€ testing-architecture.md            # Testing strategies & frameworks
â”œâ”€â”€ deployment-architecture.md         # Infrastructure & CI/CD
â”œâ”€â”€ security-architecture.md           # Security patterns & compliance
â”œâ”€â”€ performance-architecture.md        # Performance & scalability design

```

### Guidelines for Creating New Architecture Documents

**When to Create a New Architecture Document**:

- When introducing a new major feature or system component
- When implementing a new integration pattern or external dependency
- When establishing new conventions that affect multiple parts of the system
- When documenting complex business logic or domain-specific patterns
- When architectural decisions impact multiple teams or development workflows

**Document Naming Conventions**:

- Use `lowercase-kebab-case` for all architecture document filenames
- End all files with `-architecture.md` for consistency
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the feature or system area
- Keep names concise but comprehensive (e.g., `user-management-architecture.md`)

**Content Guidelines**:

- Follow the [Feature Template](../templates/feature.template.md) as a starting point
- Include both current state and planned future state
- Document integration points with other system components
- Include relevant diagrams, code examples, and configuration samples
- Reference related documentation and external resources

### Using the Feature Template

## Best Practices for Architectural Documentation

### Writing Effective Architecture Documents

1. **Start with Why**: Begin each document by explaining the business problem or technical challenge being addressed
2. **Document Decisions**: Include the reasoning behind architectural choices, not just what was implemented
3. **Include Diagrams**: Visual representations help both humans and AI understand system relationships
4. **Show Examples**: Provide concrete code examples and configuration samples
5. **Link Extensively**: Create connections between related documents and external resources
6. **Keep Current**: Regular updates ensure documentation reflects actual implementation

### Keeping Architecture Docs in Sync with Implementation

**During Development**:
- Update architecture docs when implementing new features
- Include documentation updates in the same commit as code changes
- Review architecture docs during code review process
- Validate that implementation matches documented design

**Regular Maintenance**:
- Schedule quarterly reviews of all architecture documents
- Compare documented patterns with actual codebase implementation
- Update diagrams and examples to reflect current state
- Archive or mark deprecated patterns clearly

**Change Management**:
- Document proposed changes before implementation
- Include architecture impact in change proposals
- Update related documents when making architectural changes
- Communicate changes to all stakeholders (human and AI)

### Integration with AI Branching Strategy

Architecture documentation should align with the [AI Branching Strategy](../guides/ai-branching-strategy.md):

**Feature Branches**:

- Update feature-specific architecture docs in the same branch as implementation
- Include architectural decisions in commit messages
- Reference architecture docs in pull request descriptions

**Documentation Branches**:

- Use `docs/architecture-[feature-name]` branches for major architectural changes
- Allow AI agents to create experiment branches for architecture exploration
- Require human approval for merging architecture changes to main branches

**Review Process**:

- Include architecture review in pull request templates
- Validate that code changes align with documented architectural patterns
- Check for consistency across related architecture documents

### AI-Agent Integration Guidelines

**Structured Format Requirements**:

- Use consistent heading structures across all architecture documents
- Include machine-readable metadata (version, status, dependencies)
- Maintain standardized section names for easy AI parsing
- Use clear, unambiguous language in technical descriptions

**When AI Agents Should Create Architecture Documents**:

- **Never without approval**: Architecture documents represent significant decisions
- **With explicit instruction**: "Create an architecture document for [feature] following the template"
- **For experimental work**: AI can create architecture docs in experiment branches
- **With human review**: All architecture documents require human validation before merging

**When AI Agents Should Update Architecture Documents**:

- When implementing features that affect documented architecture
- When adding examples or clarifications to existing documents
- When fixing factual errors or outdated information
- When adding cross-references between related documents

**AI Validation Requirements**:

- Check that all referenced components actually exist in the codebase
- Validate that examples compile and run correctly
- Ensure consistency with related architecture documents
- Verify that external links are functional and current

## Templates & Examples

### Feature Template Usage

The [Feature Template](../templates/feature.template.md) provides a comprehensive starting point for any architecture document. Key customization points:

1. **Replace all placeholder text** ({{FEATURE_NAME}}, {{VERSION}}, etc.)
2. **Adapt sections to your feature area** - not all sections may be relevant
3. **Add feature-specific sections** as needed (e.g., machine learning models, real-time processing)
4. **Include relevant diagrams** using Mermaid syntax or embedded images
5. **Provide concrete examples** specific to your implementation

### Quick-Start Architecture Document Creation

For rapid architecture document creation:

```bash
# Copy the template
cp docs/templates/feature.template.md docs/architecture/[feature-name]-architecture.md

# Replace placeholders with actual values
# Update metadata (version, dates, status)
# Customize sections for your specific feature
# Add diagrams and examples
# Link to related documentation
```

### Example Architecture Documents

Reference these examples for different types of architectural documentation:

- **Simple Feature**: Basic CRUD operations with standard patterns
- **Complex Integration**: Multi-service workflows with external dependencies  
- **Performance-Critical**: High-throughput systems with specific optimization requirements
- **Security-Sensitive**: Features requiring special security considerations

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Architecture Review Process

**Monthly Reviews**:

- Validate that documented architecture matches actual implementation
- Check for outdated examples, links, and references
- Identify gaps where new architecture documents are needed
- Update status indicators and progress tracking

**Feature Release Reviews**:

- Ensure new features have appropriate architectural documentation
- Update existing documents that are affected by new implementations
- Validate cross-references and dependency documentation
- Confirm that AI agents can successfully parse and use the documentation

**Annual Architecture Audits**:

- Comprehensive review of all architectural decisions and their outcomes
- Identify patterns that should be standardized or deprecated
- Plan architectural improvements and technical debt reduction
- Update architectural principles based on lessons learned

### Version Control Best Practices

**Commit Guidelines**:

- Include architecture document updates in feature implementation commits
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain architectural changes
- Reference related issues or tickets in architecture document updates
- Tag architectural decision commits for easy historical reference

**Branch Management**:

- Follow the [AI Branching Strategy](../guides/ai-branching-strategy.md) for architecture changes
- Use feature branches for architecture documents related to specific features
- Require pull request review for all architecture document changes
- Maintain consistency between code and documentation in the same branches

**Change Documentation**:

- Document the reasoning behind architectural changes
- Include migration guides when changing established patterns
- Maintain a changelog of architectural decisions
- Archive superseded architectural documents rather than deleting them

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

When making significant architectural decisions, consider creating Architecture Decision Records:

**ADR Structure**:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

**Status**: Proposed/Accepted/Superseded
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders**: [List of decision makers]

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision
What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated?
```

**When to Create ADRs**:

- Choosing between major architectural alternatives
- Introducing new technologies or frameworks
- Changing fundamental system patterns or conventions
- Making decisions that affect multiple teams or system components

### AI Agent Guidelines for Architecture Maintenance

**Automated Maintenance Tasks**:

- Validate links in architecture documents
- Check for consistency in terminology and naming
- Identify outdated version numbers or status indicators
- Flag potential gaps where documentation may be needed

**Human-Required Tasks**:

- Making architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Approving new architectural patterns or conventions
- Reviewing and validating architectural decision records
- Resolving conflicts between different architectural approaches

**Quality Assurance**:

- Ensure examples in architecture documents are functional
- Validate that documented APIs match actual implementations
- Check that dependency information is current and accurate
- Confirm that security and performance requirements are realistic
