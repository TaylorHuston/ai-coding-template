**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: P0 - Critical Foundation  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../../README.md)

## Overview

Establish a comprehensive testing framework that supports unit, integration, and end-to-end testing with code coverage reporting. This ensures code quality from the start and enables confident refactoring.

## User Story

As a developer, I want automated testing capabilities so that I can verify my code works correctly and prevent regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Unit testing framework configured and working
- [ ] Integration testing capabilities established
- [ ] End-to-end testing framework set up
- [ ] Code coverage reporting functional
- [ ] Test fixtures and factories available
- [ ] Test commands added to package.json
- [ ] Coverage threshold set to minimum 80%

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Tests run in isolation
- [ ] Parallel test execution enabled
- [ ] Mock/stub capabilities configured
- [ ] Database test fixtures automated
- [ ] Test environment variables separated

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Sample tests created for each type
- [ ] Coverage reports generated correctly
- [ ] Tests run in under 5 minutes
- [ ] CI-ready test configuration

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies

- SETUP-001 (Repository and package manager)
- SETUP-002 (Development environment for test databases)

### This Issue Blocks

- SETUP-004 (Linting includes test files)
- SETUP-007 (CI/CD needs test configuration)

## Out of Scope

- Performance testing setup
- Load testing configuration
- Security testing tools
- Visual regression testing

## Implementation Notes

- Use Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript, pytest for Python
- Configure separate test databases
- Include test data generators/factories
- Set up watch mode for TDD workflow

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Testing frameworks installed and configured
- [ ] All test types functional
- [ ] Coverage reporting working
- [ ] Sample tests passing
- [ ] Test documentation complete
- [ ] CI-ready configuration
- [ ] Team reviewed and approved
