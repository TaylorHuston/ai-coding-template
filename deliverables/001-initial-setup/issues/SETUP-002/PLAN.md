# SETUP-002: Establish Development Environment

## Goal

Create a consistent, reproducible development environment using Docker, EditorConfig, and IDE configurations to eliminate "works on my machine" problems and accelerate team onboarding.

## Tasks

### Phase 1 - Setup & Foundation
- [ ] Review existing development setup (if any)
- [ ] Identify technology stack requirements
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Document environment requirements

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation
- [ ] Create EditorConfig file
  - [ ] Configure for all file types
  - [ ] Set line endings and indentation
- [ ] Set up Docker environment
  - [ ] Create docker-compose.yml
  - [ ] Create Dockerfile.dev
  - [ ] Configure services (database, cache)
- [ ] Configure IDE settings
  - [ ] VS Code settings.json
  - [ ] Extensions recommendations
  - [ ] Debug configurations

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality
- [ ] Test Docker setup on fresh environment
- [ ] Verify cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Test all development scripts
- [ ] Ensure <30 minute setup time

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Create development setup guide
- [ ] Document troubleshooting steps
- [ ] Add environment variables documentation
- [ ] Create quick start scripts

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment
- [ ] Self-review all configurations
- [ ] Test on team member's machine
- [ ] Address feedback
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] EditorConfig file covers all project file types
- [ ] Docker Compose configured for all local services
- [ ] Development containers fully functional
- [ ] IDE settings and extensions documented
- [ ] Development scripts for common tasks created
- [ ] Environment setup completes in <30 minutes
- [ ] Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux
- [ ] All services run in containers
- [ ] Hot reload/watch mode functional
- [ ] Debugging capabilities preserved
- [ ] Database migrations automated
- [ ] Service health checks implemented
