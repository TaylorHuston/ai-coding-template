# SETUP-005 Requirements

**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: P1 - High  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../../README.md)

## Overview

Implement comprehensive observability using OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, metrics, and structured logging. This enables proactive monitoring, faster debugging, and data-driven performance optimization.

## User Story

As a developer/operator, I want full observability into the application so that I can monitor health, debug issues, and optimize performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] OpenTelemetry SDK integrated into application
- [ ] Distributed tracing functional across services
- [ ] Metrics collection implemented
- [ ] Structured logging with trace correlation
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Local observability stack operational
- [ ] Basic dashboards created

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Traces include all critical paths
- [ ] Metrics cover key performance indicators
- [ ] Logs include trace and span IDs
- [ ] Sampling configured appropriately
- [ ] Performance overhead <5%

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Telemetry data visible in local stack
- [ ] Traces properly connected
- [ ] Metrics accurately collected
- [ ] Error tracking functional

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies

- SETUP-002 (Running services to monitor)
- SETUP-001 (Repository structure)

### This Issue Blocks

- SETUP-007 (CI/CD needs metrics endpoints)
- Production deployment (requires monitoring)

## Out of Scope

- Production observability infrastructure
- Advanced dashboards and alerting
- APM vendor integration
- Log aggregation at scale

## Implementation Notes

- Use OpenTelemetry for vendor neutrality
- Start with basic metrics, expand gradually
- Include business metrics, not just technical
- Consider GDPR/privacy in logging

## Definition of Done

- [ ] OpenTelemetry fully integrated
- [ ] Local stack operational
- [ ] All telemetry types working
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Dashboards functional
- [ ] Team trained on tools
