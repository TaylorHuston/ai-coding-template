# Project Documentation

Documentation specific to YOUR application.

## What Goes Here

Project-specific content that describes your application:
- Architecture decisions (ADRs)
- System architecture and tech stack
- Design assets (mockups, color schemes)
- Feature specifications
- API contracts and database schemas

## Current Structure

```
project/
├── architecture-overview.md  # Your tech stack and system design
├── adrs/                     # Architecture Decision Records
│   ├── README.md             # ADR best practices
│   └── adr-template.md       # Template with YAML frontmatter
└── design/                   # Design assets and references
    ├── README.md
    ├── mockups/
    ├── screenshots/
    ├── color-schemes/
    └── assets/
```

## How It Grows

1. **Fill in architecture-overview.md** as you make technology choices
2. **Create ADRs** via `/architect` for important technical decisions
3. **Add design assets** to `design/` subdirectories as you work on UI/UX
4. **Create additional structure** as your project needs evolve

Documentation emerges from actual work, not upfront planning.

## Next Step

Start with your project vision:
```bash
/project-brief
```

Define what you're building and why!
