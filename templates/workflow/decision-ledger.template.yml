# Template Usage Instructions:

# 1. Copy this template for each significant decision
# 2. Replace all {{PLACEHOLDER}} values with actual content
# 3. Remove unused sections if not applicable
# 4. Update status as decision progresses through lifecycle
# 5. Add to project decision ledger file

# Decision Categories:
# - technical: Architecture, technology selection, implementation approach
# - business: Feature prioritization, scope, business rules
# - process: Workflow, methodology, team coordination
# - security: Security architecture, compliance, risk management
# - performance: Performance targets, optimization approaches
# - user-experience: UX decisions, user flow, interface choices

# Confidence Levels:
# - high: >90% confident in decision based on solid evidence
# - medium: 70-90% confident, some uncertainty remains
# - low: <70% confident, significant uncertainty or assumptions

# Risk Levels:
# - high: Significant impact if decision proves wrong
# - medium: Moderate impact, manageable consequences
# - low: Minimal impact, easy to change course

# Effort Estimates:
# - low: Days to implement
# - medium: Weeks to implement
# - high: Months to implement

# Status Values:
# - proposed: Decision option identified, not yet decided
# - approved: Decision made but not yet implemented
# - implemented: Decision has been acted upon
# - validated: Implementation results have been evaluated
# - superseded: Decision replaced by newer decision
