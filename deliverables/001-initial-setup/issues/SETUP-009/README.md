## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Initialize CHANGELOG

Create `CHANGELOG.md`:

```markdown
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

[Unreleased]: https://github.com/username/project/compare/v0.1.0...HEAD
[0.1.0]: https://github.com/username/project/releases/tag/v0.1.0
```

### Step 2: Define Branching Strategy

Create `docs/branching-strategy.md`:

```markdown
# Branching Strategy

We follow a modified GitHub Flow with environment branches.

## Branch Types

### Protected Branches

#### `main`
- Production-ready code
- Protected with required reviews
- Deploys to production

#### `develop`
- Integration branch
- Deploys to staging
- Feature branches merge here first

### Working Branches

#### Feature Branches
- Pattern: `feature/issue-number-description`
- Example: `feature/123-user-authentication`
- Created from: `develop`
- Merges to: `develop`

#### Bug Fix Branches
- Pattern: `fix/issue-number-description`
- Example: `fix/456-login-error`
- Created from: `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes)
- Merges to: `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes)

#### Release Branches
- Pattern: `release/version`
- Example: `release/1.2.0`
- Created from: `develop`
- Merges to: `main` and `develop`

#### Hotfix Branches
- Pattern: `hotfix/issue-number-description`
- Example: `hotfix/789-critical-security-fix`
- Created from: `main`
- Merges to: `main` and `develop`

## Workflow

1. Create issue in project board
2. Create branch from `develop`
3. Make changes
4. Push branch and create PR
5. Code review and CI checks
6. Merge to `develop`
7. Deploy to staging
8. Create release branch
9. Test in staging
10. Merge to `main`
11. Deploy to production
12. Tag release

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch
- Require pull request reviews (2)
- Dismiss stale reviews
- Require status checks
- Require branches be up to date
- Include administrators
- Restrict who can push

### Develop Branch
- Require pull request reviews (1)
- Require status checks
- Require branches be up to date

## Commit Standards

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

\`\`\`
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
\`\`\`

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
```

### Step 3: Configure Release Process

Create `scripts/release.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Release automation script

VERSION_TYPE=${1:-patch} # major, minor, patch
DRY_RUN=${2:-false}

echo "🚀 Starting release process..."

# Check current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "develop" ]; then
  echo "❌ Must be on develop branch"
  exit 1
fi

# Ensure clean working directory
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
  echo "❌ Working directory not clean"
  exit 1
fi

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin develop
git pull origin main

# Get current version
CURRENT_VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
echo "Current version: $CURRENT_VERSION"

# Calculate new version
NEW_VERSION=$(npx semver $CURRENT_VERSION -i $VERSION_TYPE)
echo "New version: $NEW_VERSION"

if [ "$DRY_RUN" = "true" ]; then
  echo "🔍 Dry run - no changes will be made"
  exit 0
fi

# Create release branch
RELEASE_BRANCH="release/$NEW_VERSION"
git checkout -b $RELEASE_BRANCH

# Update version in package.json
npm version $NEW_VERSION --no-git-tag-version

# Update CHANGELOG
echo "📝 Updating CHANGELOG..."
cat > CHANGELOG.tmp.md << EOF
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [$NEW_VERSION] - $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
EOF

# Extract unreleased content and append
sed -n '/## \[Unreleased\]/,/## \[/p' CHANGELOG.md | sed '1d;$d' >> CHANGELOG.tmp.md

# Append rest of changelog
sed -n '/## \['"${CURRENT_VERSION//./\\.}"'\]/,$p' CHANGELOG.md >> CHANGELOG.tmp.md

mv CHANGELOG.tmp.md CHANGELOG.md

# Commit changes
git add package.json package-lock.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore(release): $NEW_VERSION"

# Push release branch
git push origin $RELEASE_BRANCH

echo "✅ Release branch created: $RELEASE_BRANCH"
echo "📋 Next steps:"
echo "  1. Create PR from $RELEASE_BRANCH to main"
echo "  2. After merge, tag the release:"
echo "     git tag -a v$NEW_VERSION -m \"Release v$NEW_VERSION\""
echo "     git push origin v$NEW_VERSION"
echo "  3. Create GitHub release"
echo "  4. Merge main back to develop"
```

### Step 4: Create Code Review Guidelines

Create `docs/code-review.md`:

```markdown

    "changelog": "conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s",
    "version": "npm run changelog && git add CHANGELOG.md"
  }
}
```

## Verification Steps

```bash
# Test release process (dry run)
./scripts/release.sh patch true
