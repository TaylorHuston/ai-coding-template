# SETUP-002 Requirements

**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: P0 - Critical Foundation  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../../README.md)

## Overview

Create a consistent, reproducible development environment that ensures all team members work with the same configurations, tools, and settings. This eliminates environment-related issues and accelerates onboarding.

## User Story

As a developer, I want a standardized development environment so that I can quickly set up my workspace and avoid "works on my machine" problems.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] EditorConfig file covers all project file types
- [ ] Docker Compose configured for all local services
- [ ] Development containers fully functional
- [ ] IDE settings and extensions documented
- [ ] Development scripts for common tasks created
- [ ] Environment setup completes in <30 minutes
- [ ] Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] All services run in containers
- [ ] Hot reload/watch mode functional
- [ ] Debugging capabilities preserved
- [ ] Database migrations automated
- [ ] Service health checks implemented

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Setup tested on fresh environment
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified
- [ ] All development scripts tested
- [ ] Container orchestration validated

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies

- SETUP-001 (Repository initialization must be complete)
- Docker Desktop installed
- Sufficient system resources (8GB RAM minimum)

### This Issue Blocks

- SETUP-005 (Observability requires running services)
- SETUP-007 (CI/CD needs consistent environment)

## Out of Scope

- Production environment configuration
- Cloud deployment setup
- Performance optimization
- Multi-region configuration

## Implementation Notes

- Use Docker Compose for local development only
- Provide fallback for non-Docker environments
- Include database seed data for development
- Configure volume mounts for hot reload

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Docker environment running successfully
- [ ] IDE configurations working
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Setup time verified <30 minutes
- [ ] Cross-platform testing complete
- [ ] Team reviewed and approved
