# Workbench

This directory serves as your LLM's working memory. You should be using an external ticket/project management system, such as Jira or Linear. That should ultimately be your source of truth for the status, requirements, acceptace criteria, etc. But you should have your LLM feel free to make local "scratch files" as it works. This prevents it from trying to have to keep everything in the active context window, or have to frequently reference the external system, as it works. You should encoruage your LLM to create as many "temporary files" as it needs while working to keep track of things.

Create a directory for each issue that maps to that issue's key in your external system.
