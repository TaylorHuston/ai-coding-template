# Architecture Documentation Examples

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Active
**Target Audience**: Developers, System Architects

## Purpose

This directory contains **example architecture documentation** to show you how to document your own system's architecture. These are **reference examples**, not documentation for this template itself.

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Review the examples** to understand the format and level of detail
2. **Copy the structure** that fits your needs
3. **Adapt the content** for your specific system
4. **Delete these examples** when you add your own architecture docs

## Available Examples

### [System Overview](./system-overview.md)
**Purpose**: Shows how to document overall system architecture
**Use When**: Documenting high-level system design and component relationships
**Key Sections**: Architecture diagram, component overview, data flow, technology stack

### [Auth System](./auth-system.md)
**Purpose**: Shows how to document a specific feature's architecture
**Use When**: Documenting authentication, authorization, or security systems
**Key Sections**: Authentication flow, security considerations, API integration

## What to Document in Your Architecture

### System-Level Documentation
- **Overall Architecture**: High-level system design and component relationships
- **Technology Stack**: Languages, frameworks, databases, and tools
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment architecture, networking, and scaling strategy
- **Security Architecture**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection
- **Data Architecture**: Database design, data flow, and storage strategy

### Feature-Level Documentation
- **Feature Architecture**: Detailed design for major features
- **API Design**: REST/GraphQL endpoint design and contracts
- **Integration Points**: How features connect with other systems
- **Performance Considerations**: Scalability and optimization approaches

### Component-Level Documentation
- **Service Architecture**: Individual microservice or component design
- **Database Schema**: Table design and relationships
- **Business Logic**: Complex algorithms or business rules
- **External Integrations**: Third-party service connections

## Documentation Standards

### File Naming
- Use `lowercase-kebab-case.md`
- Be descriptive: `user-authentication-system.md` not `auth.md`
- Include the type: `payment-processing-architecture.md`

### Content Structure
- **Start with overview**: What this component/system does
- **Include diagrams**: Visual representation of architecture
- **Document decisions**: Why choices were made, not just what was built
- **Show relationships**: How this connects to other parts
- **Include examples**: Code snippets, configuration samples

### Maintenance
- **Update with changes**: Keep docs current with implementation
- **Version your docs**: Track changes and update dates
- **Link related docs**: Connect to API docs, user guides, etc.
- **Review regularly**: Ensure accuracy and relevance

## Templates Available

For creating new architecture documentation:

- **[Feature Architecture Template](../templates/feature-architecture.md)** - For documenting new features
- **[System Component Template](../templates/system-component.md)** - For documenting services/components

## Next Steps

1. **Review these examples** to understand the expected format
2. **Choose appropriate templates** from the templates/ directory
3. **Create your own architecture docs** following these patterns
4. **Remove these examples** when you no longer need them for reference
