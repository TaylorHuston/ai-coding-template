## 1. The Problem

_A concise, one-paragraph summary of the core problem you are solving. Be specific about the pain point._

> **Example:** "For freelance developers, managing invoices and tracking payments is a fragmented and time-consuming process. They are often forced to juggle spreadsheets, email clients, and separate payment platforms, leading to missed payments, inaccurate financial records, and wasted administrative hours that could be spent on billable work."

---

## 2. The Solution

_A high-level overview of your application and how it solves the problem. This should be the "elevator pitch" for your product._

> **Example:** "Invoicely is a streamlined, all-in-one invoicing application designed specifically for freelance developers. It combines invoice creation, automated payment reminders, and integrated payment processing into a single, intuitive dashboard, allowing users to get paid faster and spend less time on administrative tasks."

## Vision Validation Framework

### Feature Alignment Scoring
Use this framework to evaluate new features:
- **Core Problem Alignment (1-10):** How well does feature address core problem?
- **Target Audience Fit (1-10):** How well does feature serve primary users?
- **Differentiation Support (1-10):** How much does feature enhance key differentiators?
- **Success Metric Impact (1-10):** How much will feature drive primary success metrics?

**Minimum threshold for feature consideration: 28/40 total score**

### Architecture Validation
- Does technical architecture support vision scalability needs?
- Do technical decisions enable key differentiators?
- Is success metric measurement infrastructure in place?

### Planning Validation
- Are highest vision-impact items prioritized in roadmap?
- Does resource allocation align with vision-critical work?
- Are vision-threatening risks identified and mitigated?
