# SETUP-004: Linting & Code Quality

## Goal

Implement automated code quality tools including linters, formatters, and pre-commit hooks to maintain consistent code style and catch issues early in the development process.

## Tasks

### Phase 1 - Setup & Foundation
- [ ] Review team code style preferences
- [ ] Research linting tools for tech stack
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Document code standards

### Phase 2 - Core Implementation
- [ ] Install and configure linters
  - [ ] ESLint for JavaScript/TypeScript
  - [ ] Language-specific linters
  - [ ] Security linters
- [ ] Configure code formatters
  - [ ] Prettier or equivalent
  - [ ] EditorConfig integration
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks
  - [ ] Install Husky
  - [ ] Configure lint-staged
  - [ ] Add commit message validation

### Phase 3 - Testing & Quality
- [ ] Test all linting rules
- [ ] Verify pre-commit hooks work
- [ ] Fix existing code violations
- [ ] Test editor integrations

### Phase 4 - Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Document code standards
- [ ] Create style guide
- [ ] Add linting commands to README
- [ ] Document bypass procedures

### Phase 5 - Review & Deployment
- [ ] Team review of rules
- [ ] Adjust based on feedback
- [ ] Apply to entire codebase
- [ ] Merge to main branch

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Linter configured for primary language(s)
- [ ] Code formatter configured and working
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits
- [ ] Commit message format validated
- [ ] Security linting implemented
- [ ] All existing code passes checks
- [ ] Editor integration documented
- [ ] Linting rules match team standards
- [ ] Formatting is automatic on save
- [ ] Pre-commit checks run in <30 seconds
- [ ] Rules are configurable and documented
- [ ] Emergency bypass possible when needed

## Context

**Dependencies**: SETUP-001 (Repository), SETUP-003 (Test files need linting too)
**Blocks**: SETUP-007 (CI/CD needs linting configuration), All feature development
**Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, Husky, lint-staged
