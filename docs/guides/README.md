# How-To Guides

## Overview

Practical guides organized by focus area for implementing AI-assisted development workflows and solving common development challenges.

## Quick Start by Role

- **New to AI-assisted development?** → Start with [AI Collaboration Guide](../ai-collaboration-guide.md)
- **Setting up development environment?** → See [Implementation Guides](./implementation/)
- **Looking for project standards?** → Check [Project Guidelines](./project-guidelines/)
