# Comprehensive AI Agents Guide

**Your team of 18 specialized AI experts that automatically activate based on your work context.**

This comprehensive guide covers both the conceptual understanding of the AI agent system and practical guidance for effective usage.

## What Are AI Agents?

AI agents are specialized AI assistants with domain expertise that automatically activate based on your work context. Instead of getting generic responses, you get expert-level guidance tailored to specific development domains.

### The Problem Agents Solve

**Without Agents:**

- Generic AI responses that lack domain expertise
- No specialization for complex technical domains
- Poor coordination between different aspects of development
- Inconsistent quality and approach

**With Agents:**

- Expert-level responses for each domain (frontend, backend, security, etc.)
- Automatic activation based on task context
- Coordinated workflows between multiple specialties
- Consistent quality standards and best practices

## Complete 18-Agent System

## 3-Tier Agent System for `/architect` Command

The `/architect` command uses an optimized 3-tier agent consultation system to balance speed with thoroughness:

### **Tier 1: Always Consulted (Core Decisions)**

- **`code-architect`** - Primary system design and technology decisions
- **`api-designer`** - API architecture and integration patterns

*Always activated for every architectural decision, regardless of Quick or Deep Mode.*

### **Tier 2: Context-Based Consultation (Specialized Review)**

- **`security-auditor`** - Security implications and compliance requirements
- **`performance-optimizer`** - Performance impact and optimization considerations

*Activated based on decision context (e.g., security-auditor for authentication decisions).*

### **Tier 3: On-Demand Consultation (Implementation Focus)**

- **`database-specialist`** - Data architecture and persistence patterns
- **`devops-engineer`** - Infrastructure and deployment considerations
- **`frontend-specialist`** - User interface architectural patterns

*Activated only when specifically relevant or in Deep Mode (`/architect --deep`).*

### **Mode Selection:**

#### **Quick Mode (Default - 90% of decisions)**

- **Duration**: 5-10 minutes
- **Agents**: Tier 1 + context-relevant Tier 2
- **Output**: Fast Track ADR
- **Use For**: Standard architectural decisions, technology choices

#### **Deep Mode (`--deep` flag - 10% of decisions)**

- **Duration**: 20+ minutes
- **Agents**: All tiers with extended analysis
- **Output**: Detailed ADR with comprehensive analysis
- **Use For**: Complex system-wide decisions, critical infrastructure choices

### **Benefits of 3-Tier System:**

- **Faster Decisions**: Reduced coordination overhead for standard decisions
- **Maintained Quality**: Full expert consultation still available when needed
- **Context-Aware**: Intelligent agent selection based on decision type
- **Scalable Complexity**: Appropriate depth for each decision's importance

## Effective Usage Patterns

### 1. Let Agents Activate Naturally

**Good:**

```text
"I need to create a user authentication system with login/logout functionality"
```

â†’ Automatically activates: `frontend-specialist`, `backend-specialist`, `database-specialist`

**Less effective:**

```text
"Write code for authentication"
```

â†’ Generic response, no specialized agents

### 2. Request Specific Agents for Complex Work

**For architectural decisions:**

```text
"Use the code-architect to help design a microservices architecture for this e-commerce platform"
```

**For performance issues:**

```text
"Get the performance-optimizer to analyze why our API responses are slow"
```

### 3. Use Project Manager for Multi-Domain Tasks

**For complex features:**

```text
"Use the project-manager to coordinate building a real-time chat feature with frontend, backend, database, and deployment considerations"
```

## Multi-Agent Workflow Coordination

### Phase-Based Execution

Issues use a P X.X.X task structure where each phase represents a logical commit:

```markdown
## Phase 1: Core Implementation
- [ ] P1.1.0 Analyze requirements <!--agent:context-analyzer-->
- [ ] P1.2.0 Write tests <!--agent:test-engineer-->
- [ ] P1.3.0 Implement feature <!--agent:auto-select-->
- [ ] P1.4.0 Code review <!--agent:code-reviewer-->
- [ ] P1.5.0 Update docs <!--agent:technical-writer-->
- [ ] P1.6.0 Commit: "feat: core implementation"
```

### Agent Coordination System

Agents coordinate through multiple files:

**HANDOFF.yml** - Structured coordination:

- What each agent accomplished
- Context for the next agent
- Files changed and decisions made
- Current workflow state

**RESEARCH.md** - Unstructured findings:

- Investigation discoveries and context analysis
- Code snippets, dependencies, technical details
- Design considerations and rejected approaches
- Questions, assumptions, and external resources

This dual system prevents context loss and preserves valuable research that might otherwise be forgotten.

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### Sequential Workflows

Agents work in sequence for complex processes:

```text
Feature Development:
project-manager â†’ specialists â†’ code-reviewer â†’ security-auditor â†’ devops-engineer

Bug Investigation:
context-analyzer â†’ domain-specialist â†’ code-reviewer â†’ test-engineer
```

### Parallel Workflows

Multiple agents work simultaneously:

```text
Quality Assurance:
security-auditor + performance-optimizer + code-reviewer + database-specialist

Comprehensive Analysis:
All relevant domain specialists analyze different aspects simultaneously
```

### Handoff Procedures

Agents coordinate seamlessly:

1. Context preservation between agents
2. Quality gates at handoff points
3. Comprehensive briefing for next agent
4. Shared understanding of project state

## Common Workflows

### Feature Development Workflow

```text
1. "Use project-manager to plan [feature]"
2. Work begins with relevant specialists (auto-activated)
3. "Use code-reviewer to check the implementation"
4. "Use security-auditor to validate security"
5. "Use devops-engineer to deploy"
```

### Bug Investigation Workflow

```text
1. "Investigate this [bug description]"
   â†’ context-analyzer activates automatically
2. Relevant specialists join based on the issue area
3. "Use performance-optimizer" (if performance-related)
4. "Use security-auditor" (if security-related)
```

### Code Quality Workflow

```text
1. "Review this code for quality"
   â†’ code-reviewer activates
2. "Use refactoring-specialist to improve this messy code"
3. "Use performance-optimizer to speed this up"
```

## Tips for Better Results

### 1. Be Specific About Context

**Good:**

```text
"Use the frontend-specialist to create a responsive navigation component with dropdown menus for our React e-commerce site"
```

**Less effective:**

```text
"Make a navigation component"
```

### 2. Provide Domain Context

**Good:**

```text
"Use the database-specialist to optimize these slow queries in our PostgreSQL e-commerce database with 1M+ products"
```

**Less effective:**

```text
"Fix slow queries"
```

### 3. Chain Agents for Complex Tasks

```text
"Use the api-designer to plan REST endpoints for user management, then have the backend-specialist implement them, and finally the test-engineer create comprehensive tests"
```

### 4. Reference Previous Agent Work

```text
"Based on what the security-auditor found, use the refactoring-specialist to fix the identified vulnerabilities"
```

## Working with Agent Recommendations

### When Agents Suggest Using Other Agents

Agents often recommend bringing in specialists:

```text
Frontend Specialist: "For the database schema, I recommend using the database-specialist..."

You: "Use the database-specialist to design the user data schema as suggested"
```

### When You Need a Second Opinion

```text
"Get the code-architect to review the database-specialist's schema design and provide architectural feedback"
```

## Troubleshooting Agent Issues

### Agent Not Behaving as Expected?

1. **Be more explicit:**

   ```text
   "Please use the frontend-specialist agent specifically for this React component task"
   ```

2. **Provide more context:**

   ```text
   "Use the backend-specialist - we're building a Node.js Express API with MongoDB for user authentication"
   ```

3. **Check if right agent for the task:**

   - Database issues â†’ `database-specialist`
   - UI/UX work â†’ `frontend-specialist`
   - Infrastructure â†’ `devops-engineer`

### Getting Generic Responses?

This usually means no agent was activated. Try:

- Being more specific about the domain
- Explicitly requesting an agent
- Providing technical context about your stack

./.resources/scripts/metrics/generate-report.sh --period 30d --type agent-effectiveness

# Optimization strategies:
# - High usage + High success = Expand adoption
# - Low usage + High value = Increase team awareness
# - High usage + Low success = Improve agent prompts
```

#### Improve Agent Selection
```bash
# Analyze agent effectiveness by context
./.resources/scripts/metrics/query-metrics.sh --type agent --stats | \
    jq '.[] | select(.triggered_by == "command") | {agent: .name, command_success: .command_correlation}'

# Use insights to:
# - Choose optimal agent combinations
# - Improve automatic agent selection
# - Reduce redundant agent invocations
```

#### Team Performance Analysis
```bash
# Weekly agent utilization report
./.resources/scripts/metrics/generate-report.sh --period 7d --format agent-summary

# Team insights:
# - Which agents does your team use most?
# - Are specialized agents being underutilized?
# - What's the success rate correlation between agents?
```

### Agent Effectiveness Patterns

#### High-Performance Patterns
- **Complementary Pairs**: `frontend-specialist` + `backend-specialist` for full-stack features
- **Quality Chains**: `code-reviewer` â†’ `security-auditor` â†’ `performance-optimizer`
- **Investigation Sequence**: `context-analyzer` â†’ `refactoring-specialist` â†’ `test-engineer`

#### Optimization Opportunities
- **Single-Agent Tasks**: High-success, low-complexity work that can be streamlined
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Complex tasks where agent handoff can be improved
- **Workflow Integration**: Agents that should be more tightly integrated with commands

### Metrics-Driven Agent Selection

Use data to make informed agent choices:

```bash
# Compare agent effectiveness for similar tasks
./.resources/scripts/metrics/query-metrics.sh --type agent --task-similarity high --stats

# Decision framework:
# - Similar tasks with different agents = benchmark performance
# - Failed agent patterns = identify improvement opportunities
# - Successful combinations = create reusable patterns
```

### Privacy & Agent Data

- **No Code Content**: Agent metrics never include source code or sensitive data
- **Context Only**: Tracks agent selection, performance, and effectiveness patterns
- **Local Storage**: All agent performance data stays on your machine
- **Configurable**: Adjust agent tracking levels in metrics configuration

```yaml
# Agent-specific metrics configuration
collection:
  agents:
    track_performance: true
    track_combinations: true
    track_context: true
    exclude_sensitive: true
```

**ðŸŽ¯ Pro Tip**: Review agent metrics monthly to identify which specialists provide the most value for your team's specific work patterns and optimize agent selection accordingly.
