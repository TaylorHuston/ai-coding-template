## Database Design Principles

### 1. Schema Design Fundamentals

#### Normalization Strategy
```yaml
normalization_approach:
  first_normal_form:
    - Atomic values in each column
    - No repeating groups
    - Each row uniquely identifiable
    
  second_normal_form:
    - All non-key attributes fully dependent on primary key
    - Eliminate partial dependencies
    - Separate composite key dependencies
    
  third_normal_form:
    - No transitive dependencies
    - Non-key attributes depend only on primary key
    - Eliminate data redundancy
    
  denormalization_considerations:
    - Performance optimization needs
    - Read-heavy workload patterns
    - Reporting and analytics requirements
    - Calculated field storage
```

#### Data Type Selection
```yaml
data_type_strategy:
  numeric_types:
    integers:
      - Use appropriate size (INT, BIGINT, SMALLINT)
      - Consider unsigned for positive-only values
      - Use AUTO_INCREMENT for surrogate keys
      
    decimals:
      - DECIMAL for exact precision (financial data)
      - FLOAT/DOUBLE for approximate values
      - Consider precision and scale requirements
      
  string_types:
    varchar_vs_text:
      - VARCHAR for limited, indexed strings
      - TEXT for large, variable content
      - Consider character set and collation
      
    fixed_vs_variable:
      - CHAR for fixed-length data
      - VARCHAR for variable-length data
      - Consider storage efficiency
      
  temporal_types:
    datetime_strategy:
      - TIMESTAMP for timezone-aware data
      - DATETIME for timezone-naive data
      - DATE for date-only information
      - Consider timezone handling requirements
```

#### Relationship Design
```yaml
relationship_patterns:
  one_to_many:
    implementation:
      - Foreign key in "many" table
      - Referential integrity constraints

      - Project → Tasks
      
  many_to_many:
    implementation:
      - Junction/bridge table
      - Composite primary key or surrogate key
      - Foreign keys to related tables
      
    examples:

      - Products ↔ Categories
      - Students ↔ Courses
      
  one_to_one:
    implementation:
      - Shared primary key
      - Foreign key with unique constraint
