**Created**: 2025-08-23  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Priority**: P0 - Critical Foundation  
**Parent Deliverable**: [Initial Project Setup](../../../README.md)

## Overview

Implement automated code quality tools including linters, formatters, and pre-commit hooks to maintain consistent code style, catch issues early, and reduce code review friction.

## User Story

As a developer, I want automated code quality enforcement so that our codebase maintains consistent standards and quality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Linter configured for primary language(s)
- [ ] Code formatter configured and working
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits
- [ ] Commit message format validated
- [ ] Security linting implemented
- [ ] All existing code passes checks
- [ ] Editor integration documented

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Linting rules match team standards
- [ ] Formatting is automatic on save
- [ ] Pre-commit checks run in <30 seconds
- [ ] Rules are configurable and documented
- [ ] Emergency bypass possible when needed

### Testing Requirements

- [ ] Linting catches common errors
- [ ] Formatting is consistent
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks tested
- [ ] CI integration ready

## Dependencies

### Blocking Dependencies

- SETUP-001 (Repository and Git setup)
- SETUP-003 (Test files need linting too)

### This Issue Blocks

- SETUP-007 (CI/CD needs linting configuration)
- All feature development (establishes standards)

## Out of Scope

- Complex static analysis tools
- Runtime performance profiling
- Code complexity metrics
- Documentation linting (unless critical)

## Implementation Notes

- Start with recommended rule sets, customize gradually
- Use lint-staged for performance
- Provide clear bypass instructions for emergencies
- Include security-focused linting rules

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All linting tools configured
- [ ] Formatting automated
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks working
- [ ] All code passes checks
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Team consensus on rules
- [ ] Editor setup documented
