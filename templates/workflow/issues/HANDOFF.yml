    timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
    task: "P1.3.0"
    status: "completed"
    summary: "Implemented user authentication API endpoints with JWT support"

    # Mission-level tracking for ab-method integration
    mission_objective: "Complete authentication backend infrastructure"
    acceptance_criteria_met:
      - "JWT token generation and validation working"
      - "Rate limiting implemented and tested"
      - "Database schema supports user management"
      - "Security best practices followed"
    mission_dependencies_resolved: ["P1.1.0 requirements analysis", "P1.2.0 test framework"]

    # Technical implementation details for context
    technical_specs:
      api_endpoints:
        - "POST /api/auth/login - email/password → JWT token"
        - "POST /api/auth/refresh - refresh token → new JWT"
        - "GET /api/auth/profile - authenticated user data"
      database_changes:
        - "Added User model with email, password_hash, created_at fields"
        - "Created auth_tokens table for refresh token management"
      dependencies_added:
        - "jsonwebtoken@9.0.0 for JWT generation"
        - "bcrypt@5.1.0 for password hashing"
      security_implementations:
        - "Rate limiting: 5 login attempts per minute per IP"
        - "JWT expiry: 24 hours for access tokens, 7 days for refresh"
        - "Password hashing with bcrypt cost factor 12"

    # Implementation patterns and decisions
    implementation_details:
      patterns_followed:
        - "Used existing middleware pattern from middleware/auth.js"
        - "Error handling follows project convention in utils/errors.js"
        - "Input validation using joi schemas in validators/"
      architecture_decisions:
        - "JWT stored in HTTP-only cookies for security"
        - "Refresh tokens stored in database for revocation capability"
        - "User sessions tracked for concurrent login management"
      performance_considerations:
        - "Database indexes added for email and token lookups"
        - "Password hashing moved to background job for large batches"
        - "Response times: login <150ms, refresh <50ms, profile <30ms"

    # Context for next agent (critical for handoff)
    next_agent_context: |
      IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - Ready for testing integration

      Critical Info for test-engineer:
      - All endpoints return standardized response format: {success, data, error}
      - Error codes: 401 (invalid creds), 429 (rate limited), 500 (server error)
      - Test database seeding available via npm run seed:test
      - Mock JWT tokens can be generated with utils/test-helpers.js
      - Integration tests should use supertest with test database

      Integration Points for frontend-specialist:
      - Login response includes: {token, refreshToken, user: {id, email, profile}}
      - Headers required: Authorization: Bearer <token>
      - Cookie-based auth available for web clients
      - CORS configured for localhost:3000 and staging domain

    # Quality validation completed
    validation_completed:
      - "All unit tests pass (auth.test.js - 25 tests)"
      - "Integration tests pass (auth-api.test.js - 15 tests)"
      - "Security scan completed - no critical vulnerabilities"
      - "Performance tests meet requirements (<200ms avg)"
      - "Code review by senior dev - approved with minor comments"
