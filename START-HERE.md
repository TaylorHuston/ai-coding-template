# 🚀 Start Here - Your First 5 Minutes

**New to this template? You're in the right place!**

This template transforms AI from a simple code generator into your intelligent architectural partner. Instead of forgetting context and making isolated decisions, AI will remember everything and help you build better software.

## 🎯 **Choose Your Path** (Pick One)

### 🏃‍♂️ **Path 1: Quick Demo** (2 minutes)
*"Just show me what this does"*

```bash
# Copy this template and see it in action
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-coding-template.git my-project && cd my-project
npm run demo
```

### 🛠️ **Path 2: Create Your Project** (10 minutes)
*"I want to transform this template into MY project"*

```bash
# Transform template into your real project
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-coding-template.git my-awesome-project
cd my-awesome-project
./scripts/setup-manager.sh init-project
```

**🧠 What happens during setup:**
1. **Claude Code Verification** - Ensures AI tools are ready
2. **Project Discovery** - Understands your project type (web-app, API, CLI, etc.)
3. **Business Context** - B2B SaaS, consumer, internal, open-source
4. **External Integrations** - Connects Jira, Linear, Confluence, Notion
5. **Professional README** - Industry-standard docs tailored to your project
6. **Template Preservation** - All guidance moved to `docs/ai-tools/`

### 🚀 **Path 3: Try the AI Workflow** (15 minutes)
*"I want to experience the /idea → /plan → /iterate flow"*

```bash
# After project setup, try your first AI-assisted feature
/idea --start "How should we implement user authentication?"
# → Guided architectural exploration with specialist consultation
```

### 📚 **Path 4: Learn the System** (30 minutes)
*"I want to understand how this works"*

## 🤔 **What Problem Does This Solve?**

### **Before: Traditional AI Coding**
- ❌ AI forgets context between conversations
- ❌ Architectural decisions made in isolation
- ❌ Inconsistent patterns across the codebase
- ❌ No memory of why decisions were made

### **After: AI Architectural Partnership**
- ✅ Perfect context preservation across long projects
- ✅ Guided architectural exploration with expert consultation
- ✅ Systematic planning with specialist agents
- ✅ Quality-validated execution with automatic documentation

## 🔄 **Intelligent Template → Project Transformation**

**🚀 Revolutionary Feature**: AI-powered project initialization that understands YOUR needs!

```bash
# Traditional templates: One-size-fits-all nightmare
git clone template → manually replace README → guess configuration → lose context

# AI Coding Template: Intelligent transformation
./scripts/setup-manager.sh init-project
```

**🎯 Intelligence Features:**
- **🔍 Smart Discovery**: Detects if you're building a web app, API, CLI tool, library, mobile app, or enterprise solution
- **🏢 Business Awareness**: Understands B2B SaaS vs consumer vs internal tools vs open-source
- **👥 Team Integration**: Adapts to solo developer vs small team vs enterprise
- **🔗 Tool Connection**: Integrates with Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues, Confluence, Notion
- **📋 Professional Docs**: Generates industry-standard README tailored to your exact project type
- **🧠 Preserved Knowledge**: Template docs safely moved to `docs/ai-tools/` for reference

## 📋 **The Magic: 3-Phase Workflow**

Instead of "AI, write me some code," you get:

### 1. 💡 **Explore** (`/idea`)
- Interactive conversation about architectural decisions
- On-demand specialist consultation (security, performance, etc.)
- Comprehensive decision documentation (ADRs)

### 2. 📋 **Plan** (`/plan`)
- Multi-agent analysis by domain experts
- Phase-based implementation roadmap (P1 → P2 → P3)
- Complete context preservation in coordination files

### 3. ⚡ **Execute** (`/iterate`)
- Task-by-task execution with appropriate specialists
- Quality gates between every phase
- Perfect memory of all decisions and context

## 🎪 **See It In Action** (30 seconds)

Here's what a real workflow looks like:

```bash
# 1. EXPLORE: Guided architectural conversation
/idea --start "Should we use microservices or monolith?"
# → 10-minute conversation with architecture expert
# → Decision documented with full rationale

# 2. PLAN: Expert analysis and task breakdown
/plan --issue AUTH-123
# → 5 agents analyze: security, backend, frontend, database, testing
# → 12 tasks generated across 3 phases with quality gates

# 3. EXECUTE: Quality execution with perfect memory
/iterate
# → P1.1.0 ✅ → P1.2.0 ✅ → P1.3.0 ✅ (Phase 1 complete)
# → P2.1.0 ✅ → P2.2.0 ✅ → P2.3.0 ✅ (Phase 2 complete)
# → P3.1.0 ✅ → P3.2.0 ✅ → P3.3.0 ✅ (Phase 3 complete)
# Result: Production-ready feature with full documentation
```

**Total time: 30 minutes of guided work vs. 3 hours of back-and-forth**
