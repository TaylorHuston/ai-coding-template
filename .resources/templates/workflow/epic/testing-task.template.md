# TASK-{{TASK_NUMBER}}: {{TASK_NAME}}

**Status**: pending
**External Ref**: {{EXTERNAL_REF}}
**Coverage Target**: {{COVERAGE_TARGET}}

## Testing Scope
{{TESTING_SCOPE}}

## Test Types Required
- [ ] Unit Tests: Component and function level testing
- [ ] Integration Tests: Component interaction testing
- [ ] End-to-End Tests: Complete user journey testing
- [ ] Performance Tests: Load and response time validation
- [ ] Security Tests: Authentication and authorization validation

## BDD Test Scenarios
<!-- Generated from acceptance criteria -->
### Scenario: [Test Scenario Name]
**Given** [initial test context]
**When** [test action occurs]
**Then** [expected test outcome]

## Implementation Tasks
<!-- Added by /plan command -->
<!-- Format: X.Y.Z for precise referencing -->

### 1.1.0 Test Framework Setup
- [ ] 1.1.1 Install and configure testing framework (Jest/Vitest/Cypress)
- [ ] 1.1.2 Setup test coverage reporting and thresholds
- [ ] 1.1.3 Configure CI/CD test integration and quality gates

### 1.2.0 Test Data Management
- [ ] 1.2.1 Create test fixtures and factories
- [ ] 1.2.2 Setup database seeding for tests
- [ ] 1.2.3 Implement test isolation and cleanup strategies

### 1.3.0 Unit Test Implementation
- [ ] 1.3.1 Write component unit tests
- [ ] 1.3.2 Write function and utility tests
- [ ] 1.3.3 Achieve {{COVERAGE_TARGET}} unit test coverage

### 1.4.0 Integration Test Implementation
- [ ] 1.4.1 Write API endpoint integration tests
- [ ] 1.4.2 Write database integration tests
- [ ] 1.4.3 Write service integration tests

### 1.5.0 End-to-End Test Implementation
- [ ] 1.5.1 Write user journey E2E tests
- [ ] 1.5.2 Write critical path E2E tests
- [ ] 1.5.3 Setup E2E test environment and data

### 1.6.0 Performance Test Implementation
- [ ] 1.6.1 Write load testing scenarios
- [ ] 1.6.2 Write response time validation tests
- [ ] 1.6.3 Setup performance monitoring and alerts

## Dependencies
- Testing framework ADR decisions from resources/
- Completed feature implementation tasks
- Test environment infrastructure

## Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before task completion
- Coverage target of {{COVERAGE_TARGET}} must be achieved
- Performance benchmarks must be met
- Security tests must validate authentication/authorization

## Notes
- Auto-invoke test-engineer agent for implementation
- Follow TDD/BDD methodology throughout development
- Maintain test-first approach for all new features
- Update test suite for any feature changes
