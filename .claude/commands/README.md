## üöÄ Workflow Usage Patterns

### The Complete Workflow (Recommended for All Features)

```yaml
core_workflow: "/feature ‚Üí /architect ‚Üí /plan ‚Üí /develop"

phase_1_feature:
  command: "feature"
  duration: "5-10 minutes"
  output: "Feature brief with context and requirements"
  description: "Business context, users, requirements, dependencies"

phase_2_architecture:
  command: "architect"
  duration: "10-20 minutes"
  output: "ADR(s) and technical design"
  description: "Explore alternatives, trade-offs, decisions"

phase_3_planning:
  command: "plan"
  duration: "8-10 minutes"
  output: "PLAN.md + HANDOFF.yml + RESEARCH.md"
  description: "Sequential multi-agent analysis and task generation"

phase_4_execution:
  command: "develop"
  duration: "Variable (per task)"
  output: "Quality-validated implementation"
  description: "Agent-orchestrated task execution with context preservation"

total_workflow_time: "30-60 minutes planning + implementation time"
quality_gates: "Built-in at every phase transition"
```

### Alternative Patterns (Legacy Support)

## Claude Code Best Practices Applied

All commands now follow Claude Code standards:

### ‚úÖ **Proper File Structure**

- **File Extensions**: All commands use `.md` extension for proper Claude Code recognition
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Complete metadata with description, argument hints, allowed tools, and model specifications
- **Argument Handling**: Support for `$ARGUMENTS` and positional parameters

### ‚úÖ **Command Features**

- **Tool Restrictions**: Specific allowed-tools to ensure security and proper functionality
- **Model Selection**: Appropriate model complexity (haiku/sonnet/opus) for each command's requirements
- **Agent Integration**: Clear specification of which specialized agents each command leverages

### ‚úÖ **Usage Patterns**

- **Slash Command Syntax**: All commands accessible via `/command-name arguments` format
- **Parameter Support**: Flexible argument parsing for different command contexts
- **Project Integration**: Commands work within project structure and conventions
